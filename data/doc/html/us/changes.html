<p><b>v0.189, 30-AUG-2017:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>fix: corrected build issues when using Qt 5.9.x (<a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=157" target="_blank">BT #157</a>)</li>
	<li>fix: software-lists: repeat the last search when the software-list is reloaded and a non-empty search pattern is present (<a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=158" target="_blank">BT #158</a>)</li>
	<li>fix: welcome dialog: explicitly set the GUI font if it has been customized before</li>
	<li>imp: ignore the new <i>dtd</i> emulator option when checking the template map</li>
	<li>imp: MinGW builds: changed the Makefile to support the newer MAME-dev tools, including Qt 5, but Qt 4 is still recommended (note that for Qt 5 <code>&lt;mingw-folder&gt;/usr/bin/sh.exe</code> <b>must be renamed or removed</b>, otherwise <code>qmake</code> won't produce correct paths - see <a href="https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-48876" target="_blank">QTBUG-48876</a> which unfortunately isn't fixed but <i>closed</i>)</li>
	<li>imp: updated category.ini to MAME 0.189</li>
</ul>
<p><b>v0.187, 02-JUL-2017:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>fix: software-lists: reverted a change from v0.183 which prevented multi-part software from being mounted correctly (<a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=145" target="_blank">BT #145</a>)</li>
	<li>fix: fixed that the system-notes widget gets hidden when a machine is launched while the "notes" tab is the current one (<a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=147" target="_blank">BT #147</a>)</li>
	<li>fix: corrected loading zipped custom artwork data for notes templates (<a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=149" target="_blank">BT #149</a>)</li>
	<li>fix: notes-editor: avoid a potential (temporary) hang caused by text-wrapping the generated JS/HTML code when switching to the HTML tab (<a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=150" target="_blank">BT #150</a>)</li>
	<li>fix: QMC2 Arcade / ToxicWaste theme: some theme-specific settings were not correctly restored</li>
	<li>fix: software-lists: software images weren't correctly updated on the search results page</li>
	<li>imp: updated the alternative system- and software-notes templates contributed by <a href="credits.html#Shideravan">Jos&eacute; Marcio Rezende Franco</a></li>
	<li>imp: notes-editor: the notes-editor's tab-bar uses a smaller font size now (2/3 of the general application font's size)</li>
	<li>imp: updated category.ini to MAME 0.187</li>
	<li>imp: QMC2 Arcade / ToxicWaste theme: delay image, video and info updates when the user flicks the machine list quickly</li>
	<li>imp: QMC2 Arcade / ToxicWaste theme: the cabinet can now be scaled independently from its automatic positioning (mouse wheel) and the menu bar's fade-in/out is animated</li>
	<li>new: added optional support for dynamically filtering machines according to their potentially changing ROM states during full audits (<a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=144" target="_blank">BT #144</a>)</li>
	<li>new: QMC2 Arcade: added support for the icon cache database (used if enabled in the main GUI)</li>
	<li>new: QMC2 Arcade: added the new CLI option <code>-debugqt</code> which will enable logging of Qt debug messages (which are now suppressed by default)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>v0.186, 14-JUN-2017:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>fix: manual scanner: convert relative paths to absolute ones (so that the file URLs are correctly interpreted when launching the PDF viewer)</li>
	<li>fix: collection rebuilder: the collection rebuilder's specific settings weren't stored under certain circumstances</li>
	<li>fix: corrected the initial restoration of the tab-header of the current machine-detail when the tab-header has to be scrolled</li>
	<li>fix: corrected UI behavior when the given emulator executable file's path does not exist during reload (<a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=143" target="_blank">BT #143</a>)</li>
	<li>fix: ROMAlyzer: added a hard limit of 2 GB per analyzed dump (the analyzer will skip individual dumps which are bigger than QByteArray's limit, avoiding a crash)</li>
	<li>fix: avoid a crash when interrupting a ROM verification of tagged sets (the process is now cleanly interruptable)</li>
	<li>fix: the <i>enable log</i> settings of the check-sum scanner log and the collection rebuilder were not restored</li>
	<li>fix: corrected the ROM- and software-state checks to work with MAME 0.186+</li>
	<li>imp: software-lists: removed the temporary workaround for launching ColecoVision&trade; cartridge images since the issue has been fixed in MAME 0.184</li>
	<li>imp: updated category.ini to MAME 0.186</li>
	<li>imp: added a confirmation pop-up which tells the user that it's much faster to do a full ROM audit than to check ROM states individually above a certain amount of sets (shown for more than 500 tagged sets)</li>
	<li>imp: removed the <i>-qmc2_config_path</i> option which was renamed to <i>-config_path</i> in v0.42 (the old name was still supported as a more or less hidden alias)</li>
	<li>imp: ROMAlyzer: renamed the former <i>Report</i> tab to <i>Analyzer</i> and moved the related widgets to it, so that they are no longer suggesting a global meaning</li>
	<li>new: collection rebuilder: added support for rebuilding dumps that are larger than 2 GB individually (e.g. 'hapyfsh2', see <a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=142" target="_blank">BT #142</a>)</li>
	<li>new: notes-templates: added access functions for PDF manuals (see <a href="http://wiki.batcom-it.net/index.php?title=The_%27ultimate%27_guide_to_QMC2#PDF_manuals">wiki</a>)</li>
	<li>wip: ROMAlyzer: adding a <i>ROM path cleaner</i> sub-feature (<a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=82" target="_blank">BT #82</a>)</li>
	<li>wip: adding an advanced setup wizard as an alternative to the classic welcome dialog</li>
</ul>
<p><b>v0.183, 22-FEB-2017:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>fix: corrected the start-up restoration of the currently selected machine when said machine is hidden in the main view (aka 'full detail view') due to ROM state filtering</li>
	<li>fix: template check: when a (presumably) boolean type option changes its semantic, make sure that the check at least sees the changed default (example: the 'sound' option in current MAME)</li>
	<li>fix: correctly honor the <i>ShowROMStatusIcons</i> setting in the main view when the machine list is loaded from cache</li>
	<li>fix: system-notes: got rid of some MAME/MESS/UME leftovers (OMG!) which prevented titles from being displayed in system-notes when they were (7-)zipped</li>
	<li>imp: updated category.ini to MAME 0.183</li>
	<li>imp: updated PDF.js to a newer git revision (as of 30-JAN-2017), now pre-built with <code>gulp</code></li>
	<li>imp: changed the category- and version-views to do an ascending sort of the category or version column before running the actual sort on the current criteria upon creation</li>
	<li>imp: avoid UI flicker when initially creating the category- or version-views</li>
	<li>imp: updated the emulator configuration templates to MAME 0.183 (changed the 'sound' option to correspond with current MAME)</li>
	<li>imp: improved the main setup dialog's (former) <i>Machine-list</i> tab (now called <i>Machine- / Software-lists</i>) by reorganizing the different options in separate sections</li>
	<li>imp: software-lists: get rid of using a temporary file for looking up mountable devices for the current slot setup, use the standard input channel instead (we actually got rid of using a temporary file <b>completely</b>, so the corresponding setting has been removed as well)</li>
	<li>imp: device configurator: adopted MAME's new formatting of the <code>-listslots</code> output (this means that <b>MAME 0.183 is required now!</b>)</li>
	<li>imp: component setup: when a feature isn't allowed to be removed (i.e. the per-machine emulator configuration), indicate this by disabling the <i>deactivate</i> button</li>
	<li>imp: the context-menu of each component's tab-widget is now accessible by right-clicking the header (instead of a small area above it)</li>
	<li>imp: software-lists: use <code>list:name</code> instead of <code>list:name:part</code> when generating software-specific arguments</li>
	<li>imp: software-lists: added a (temporary) workaround for launching ColecoVision&trade; cartridge images (see <a href="http://mametesters.org/view.php?id=6504" target="_blank">MT bug #6504</a>)</li>
	<li>imp: device configurator: a loading animation is shown when the slot info cache has to be recreated (the previous indication for this was too subtle)</li>
	<li>new: the last ten machine search patterns that were added to the drop-down list (i.e. by pressing <i>Return</i> or <i>Enter</i>) are saved and restored now</li>
	<li>new: added a <i>relaunch setup wizard</i> item to the tools menu which will stop and restart QMC2 with the <code>-r</code> command line option</li>
	<li>new: software-lists: added support for saving and restoring the last selected software item per system (<a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=140" target="_blank">BT #140</a>)</li>
	<li>new: added support for system- and software-manuals (in PDF format), allowing the use of an external PDF viewer (system default) as an alternative to the internal one which doesn't work everywhere (<a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=141" target="_blank">BT #141</a>, <a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=116" target="_blank">BT #116</a>)</li>
	<li>new: each component's current tab can also be switched through the tab-widget header's context-menu now (<a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=134" target="_blank">BT #134</a>)</li>
	<li>inf: changed the versioning scheme to match MAME's version from now on (due to popular demand) - this should avoid confusion in the future</li>
</ul>
<p><b>v0.71, 26-JAN-2017:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>fix: software-lists: corrected the initial update of custom software artwork when the images are loaded from a zip- or 7z-archive (<a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=137" target="_blank">BT #137</a>)</li>

	<li>imp: updated PDF.js to a newer git revision (as of 12-JAN-2017)</li>
	<li>imp: updated the emulator configuration templates to MAME 0.182 (added HTTP server and PortAudio options)</li>

	<li>fix: honor the component setup / tab order when updating the tab icon for the currently selected view</li>
	<li>imp: removed all 'terminate emulator' actions as they don't work with modern MAME ('kill emulator' actions still work and got a nicer icon)</li>

	<li>new: reimplemented the support for MAME output notifiers in a platform independent way (this requires a <i>modern</i> version of MAME)</li>
 	<li>new: software-lists: added optional automatic adjustment of the emulator's <i>-statename</i> parameter for easier state-file separation -- see also <a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=129" target="_blank">BT #129</a></li>
</ul>

	<li>new: added a catver.ini optimizer to potentially speed up loading slightly</li>
	<li>new: emulator identification is now skipped when the binary's modification time hasn't changed - this generally speeds up loading greatly (but can be disabled in case it causes any trouble)</li>

 	<li>imp: ROMAlyzer (software-mode): the widget is now shown (but disabled) while the software-list XML cache is rebuilt; it gets enabled when the cache is ready (this avoids working on premature data)</li>
 	<li>imp: updated the alternative system- and software-notes templates contributed by <a href="credits.html#Shideravan">Jos&eacute; Marcio Rezende Franco</a></li>
 	<li>imp: MAME/MESS/UME emulator templates updated to 0.158 (added new SDL2 option 'uifontprovider')</li>
 	<li>imp: interrupt a running search immediately when the system- or software-search's pattern changes</li>
 	<li>new: due to popular demand, the system search can now be configured to include (default) or exclude BIOS and device sets via the menu attached to the pattern input</li>

 	<li>imp: QMC2 Arcade: added support for theme-specific default values used by certain settings -- i.e. <i>darkone</i> uses a 'sortByName' setting with an expected default value of 'true', <i>ToxicWaste</i> doesn't (want to) support this setting and uses the global default value of 'false' instead</li>
 	<li>imp: QMC2 Arcade: be more responsive while loading data from file (especially interesting when using a console window)</li>

 	<li>imp: improved ROM state filtering performance by resetting the internal state of the tree-widget before actually showing/hiding the items</li>
 	<li>imp: don't be fussy about <i>ignored</i> options when checking emulator configuration templates (they are ignored for good reason, so why confuse users by mentioning them?)</li>
 	<li>imp: QMC2 Arcade (Windows): when started from a command prompt, console-mode 'terminal' now causes QMC2 Arcade to use this console for logging</li>

 	<li>new: automatically clear all emulator caches when the output of '-listfull' changes (optional, enabled by default) -- something users often forget is using QMC2's -cc command line switch when updating their MAME/MESS/UME SVN builds; this feature is supposed to automate that as far as possible (changes to devices and software-lists aren't recognized automatically)</li>
 	<li>new: added command line option '-tc' which will check the emulator configuration template (printing results to <i>stdout</i>) and exit before actual start-up occurs</li>

 	<li>imp: made XML cache loading/creation an interruptable process</li>
 	<li>imp: X11 and Windows only: the scaling mode for snapshots taken through the embedder can now be selected</li>
 	<li>imp: using Qt's built-in (= non-native) standard file-dialogs wherever possible (you can optionally switch back to using native dialogs, however, we don't recommend it due to possible issues on some platforms or desktop systems)</li>
 	<li>imp: added a 'reset' action to all header context-menus (will make all contained columns visible and stretch them equally)</li>
 	<li>imp: added support for samples to all MESS targets as well (MESS supports samples since sometime after 0.148u3), however, this doesn't include the sample-checker yet</li>

 	<li>new: system- and software-notes templates: added two new slots for use with zipped images: 'qmc2NEO.isZippedImage()' will determine if an image is from a ZIP, 'qmc2NEO.getImageData()' will return the base64-encoded image data which you can use in &lt;img&gt; tags (<b>caution: may be slow and will inflate the HTML enormously -- only use this with the WYSIWYG editor!</b>)</li>
 	<li>new: HTML editor: added an option to show/hide the HTML tab</li>
 	<li>new: system- and software-notes templates: added support for querying the XML (from -listxml) using XQuery through the new slots 'qmc2NEO.queryXml()' (will execute an XQuery on the complete XML data, warning: may be slow), 'qmc2NEO.queryLocalXml()' (same as before, restricted to a single game/machine and thus much faster) and 'qmc2NEO.getXmlResult()' (will return the list of result strings as an array)</li>
 	<li>new: search-patterns used to match games/machines or software-list entries can now be <i>negated</i> on-the-fly through a setup-menu attached to the search-box's find button</li>
 	<li>new: promoted 'Qt CHDMAN GUI' (see tools/qchdman) to non-WIP status as it meanwhile supports all 'chdman' commands</li>

 	<li>new: added support for state-checking, -caching &amp; -filtering of software-lists</li>
 	<li>new: added a <i>source file</i> column to all game-/machine-list views</li>

 	<li>new: added new QMC2 Arcade theme 'darkone' including additional functionality by <a href="credits.html#Pete">Pete Beardmore</a></li>
 	<li>new: QMC2 Arcade's default values for the command line switches <i>-theme</i>, <i>-console</i> and <i>-graphicssystem</i> now follow any customizations made in the main GUI's arcade mode setup dialog</li>
 	<li>wip: adding support for freely definable <i>additional artwork classes</i> (system- or software-images)</li>
 	<li>doc: the QMC2 FAQ has been <b>moved</b> to the <a href="http://wiki.batcom-it.net/index.php?title=QMC2_FAQ" target="_blank">wiki</a></li>

 	<li>imp: system-notes: template macro additions ($PARENT_ID$, $ROM_STATUS$ and $ROM_STATUS_UT$)</li>
 	<li>imp: updated MESS/UME variant logos / splash-screens and all app-icons -- thanks to <a href="credits.html#JacKc">Jacques Châtelet (JacKc)</a></li>
 	<li>imp: demo-mode: added an option to launch emulators sequentially rather than randomly</li>
 	<li>imp: Win32 MinGW build: changed the default for 'MKSPEC' to 'win32-g++-4.6' -- <b>this assumes Qt 4.8</b>, so whoever still uses Qt 4.7 has to pass 'MKSPEC=win32-g++' on the make command (i.e. 'make configure MKSPEC=win32-g++')</li>
 	<li>imp: image-checker: potentially obsolete items contained in image- or icon-directories include files <b>and</b> folders now</li>
 	<li>imp: control-panel images are now available to all MESS variants as well (i. e. for use with <a href="http://www.progettosnaps.net/mess/" target="_blank">AntoPISA's new <i>MESS controllers</i></a>)</li>
 	<li>imp: YouTube video player: added support for YouTube's new requirement to add session signatures to stream URLs</li>
 	<li>imp: removed no longer required file-removal tool settings</li>
 	<li>imp: MAME/MESS/UME emulator templates updated to 0.148</li>
 	<li>imp: Mac OS X: replaced key-sequence 'Ctrl+O' with 'Ctrl+,' (commonly used short-cut for <i>open preferences dialog</i>); 'Ctrl+O' can now be used for its actual use case on Mac OS X (<i>open/activate item</i>)</li>
 	<li>imp: software-lists: added a 'supported' column (possible values: yes/no/partially)</li>
 	<li>imp: HTML editor: the menu-bar can be hidden now, and the editor's contents can be made read-only (i.e. to avoid unintended changes)</li>
 	<li>imp: system- and software-notes: template loading allows asynchronous URL retrieval now (i.e. remote image URLs), indicating the current progress while loading</li>
 	<li>imp: HTML editor: replaced the standard QWebView with the MiniWebBrowser's tweaked internal web-view to support JavaScript actions that open new windows</li>
 	<li>imp: software-notes: template macro additions ($SOFTWARE_SUPPORTED$, $SOFTWARE_SUPPORTED_UT$, $SOFTWARE_INFO$, $SOFTWARE_INFO_STATUS$)</li>
 	<li>imp: the documentation browser's zoom-setting is now restored as well</li>
 	<li>imp: added ability to store an option's short-name in the emulator configuration template (i. e. <i>&lt;option default="roms" name="rompath" shortname="rp" type="directory"&gt;)</i></li>
 	<li>imp: using a proxy-style when Qt 5 is detected to avoid single-click item activations (that's not really suitable for us)</li>
 	<li>new: ROMAlyzer: the set rewriter and checksum wizard now also load repro-data from regular files (when they are stored in expected folders and have the correct file names / CRCs), the set rewriter can also reproduce sets in individual sub-directories (see 'reproduction type' in ROMAlyzer settings)</li>

 	<li>new: image-checker: <i>bad</i> image files (subset of the <i>missing</i> ones) can now be filtered and removed by means of the GUI (so searching for bad image files in the log and manually removing them is no longer required)</li>
 	<li>new: made a complete rewrite of the sample-checker which wasn't working correctly for ages -- see also <a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=31" target="_blank">BT #31</a></li>
 	<li>new: MiniWebBrowser: added a search widget to find arbitrary text in web-pages</li>
 	<li>new: MiniWebBrowser: added support for persistent cookies (stored in / retrieved from an SQLite database)</li>
 	<li>new: added <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/PDF.js" target="_blank">PDF.js</a> -- a JavaScript / HTML5 PDF rendering library</li>
 	<li>new: added support for HTML5 'localStorage' to the MiniWebBrowser and notes-templates (this allows templates to store and retrieve local settings)</li>
 	<li>new: system- and software-notes templates: exposing the notes-editor object to JavaScript allowing templates to call editor slots directly (!) -- right now, there are four slots you can use: 'qmc2NotesEditorObject.loadCurrentTemplate()' will reload the template itself (for example to react on changed settings), 'qmc2NotesEditorObject.getIconData()' will return the base64-encoded icon data which you can use in &lt;img&gt; tags, 'qmc2NotesEditorObject.getColor()' will open a color-dialog and returns a named color, and finally 'qmc2NotesEditorObject.getImage()' will open a file-dialog to select an image file (see data/gmn/template.html for an example)</li>
 	<li>new: MESS device configurator: allow in-place renaming of stored device configurations (see context menu)</li>
 	<li>new: added support for a 'software info DB' using MAME history.dat's new (MAME &amp; MESS) software infos, available in all variants -- thanks to <a href="http://www.arcade-history.com" target="_blank">Alexis Bousiges</a> for his efforts and kind cooperation on this matter</li>
 	<li>new: added ability to reset, revert and/or store <i>individual</i> emulator options by adding a column with respective action tool-buttons that are enabled/disabled according to the option's current ini-state</li>
 	<li>new: file-chooser: folders can now be included in the file-list and are opened/followed when double-clicked or Enter/Return is pressed on them (there's also a new context-menu item for this); the <i>folder-mode</i> itself can be switched through a new menu-button in the widget's tool-bar (folders are hidden by default, select 'Show folders' to display them or 'Show folders first' to show them on top of the file-list, before any regular files)</li>
 	<li>new: added a new QML based implementation of the long-awaited 'arcade mode' as a stand-alone application (<i>QMC2 Arcade</i>, see arcade/ folder)</li>
 	<li>new: added support for Qt 5.0, however, the <b>recommended Qt version remains 4.8</b> (when Qt 5 is used, the build rules will automatically disable embedder functionality on X11 platforms as well as all Phonon features on all platforms -- this is due to dropped Qt modules, add-on modules may cover this later perhaps)</li>
 	<li>new: added alternative system- and software-notes templates contributed by <a href="credits.html#Shideravan">Jos&eacute; Marcio Rezende Franco</a></li>
 	<li>new: added MESS category.ini contributed by <a href="http://forums.bannister.org/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showprofile&User=5387" target="_blank">ASH</a></li>

 	<li>fix: don't allow tagging/untagging of parent-items in category- and version-views</li>
 	<li>fix: file-browsers in emulator configuration dialogs used the wrong standard file-dialog so non-existing file names weren't accepted</li>
 	<li>fix: ZIP-archived image files weren't correctly opened initially</li>
 	<li>fix: full-screen switching on Ubuntu 12.04 (<i>Unity</i> desktop) didn't work correctly -- see <a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=26" target="_blank">BT #26</a></li>

 	<li>fix: non-Windows: the optional memory indicator wasn't updated because the corresponding timer didn't fire</li>
 	<li>fix: MESS device configurator: when a configuration made with the file-chooser was saved, the current slot setup wasn't stored together with it -- rendering the stored item useless when slot customizations were required</li>
 	<li>fix: corrected ROM status determination for sets containing only CHDs (but no ROMs)</li>
 	<li>fix: the current emulator selection made on the game/machine-specific configuration tab wasn't saved upon reload</li>

 	<li>imp: integrated zlib updated to version 1.2.7 (see <a href="http://zlib.net/ChangeLog.txt" target="_blank">zlib's change-log</a> for details)</li>
 	<li>imp: Win32 MinGW build: added OS auto-detection for Windows so specification of MINGW=1 is no longer required (however, if MINGW is set, its value will be used regardless)</li>
 	<li>imp: when a non-default (= foreign) emulator is selected for the current game/machine, the device-mapper and software-list tabs are disabled now</li>
 	<li>imp: sets with <i>empty</i> names are now ignored, logging corresponding warnings when the game/machine list cache is recreated (this is a driver bug which also '-validate' will warn about)</li>

 	<li>imp: file-chooser: opened ZIP contents are sorted as well</li>
 	<li>imp: completely revised the image cache internals, now also storing the file path the cached image was loaded from, which can be retrieved via the image's context-menu (the file path is not available in case of zipped images, though)</li>
 	<li>imp: much better GUI response while recreating the XML cache and checking all ROMs (full audit)</li>
 	<li>imp: animate searching for game/machine XML data when the user expands an item in the primary (full-detail) view</li>
 	<li>imp: the menu-bar on Mac OS X is no longer 'native' because this misbehaves with <i>multiple</i> menu-bars that we have now</li>
 	<li>imp: emulator configuration widgets are now initially hidden and shown after all options were loaded, which speeds up this process a little bit (you won't see a <i>visual</i> difference, though)</li>

 	<li>new: added a check for the ROM path setting (a warning message will pop up when the ROM path hasn't been set or isn't available) -- see <a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=28" target="_blank">BT #28</a></li>
 	<li>new: made a complete rewrite of the image-checker dialog, which now allows checks of ALL image types in a multi-threaded way -- this also fixes a long-standing bug on Windows, BTW (see <a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=5" target="_blank">BT #5</a>)</li>

 	<li>new: items in all game/machine list views can now be tagged/untagged while the 'cursor' is moved, using the new (customizable) short-cuts Shift+Up and Shift+Down (works much like in 'Total Commander' when tagging/untagging files or folders)</li>
 	<li>new: the file-chooser now offers an additional context-menu item to open regular files (<b>not</b> ZIP content yet!) externally by launching the default application that's associated with the file's MIME type (or extension)</li>
 	<li>new: added a 'personal rich-text notes' detail for games/machines (same as the software-notes feature, but for systems this time)</li>

<p><b>v0.36, 21-MAY-2012:</b></p>
<ul>
 	<li>fix: ROMAlyzer: don't stop searching for CHDs at the first ROM path (when there are multiple ROM paths)</li>
 	<li>fix: allow embedding of (MAME/MESS-like) foreign emulators again -- changes made in 0.35 prevented this completely</li>
 	<li>fix: changed the default short-cut for the <i>check template map</i> action to 'Ctrl+Shift+C' -- the previous default of 'Ctrl+C' was awkward since it's usually used as short-cut for <i>copy to clipboard</i></li>
 	<li>fix: avoid crashes in the game list parser and the ROMAlyzer's checksum wizard due to unexpected nameless entries (first appeared in MESS 0.145u1+)</li>
 	<li>fix: build: corrected a new set of compile-time bugs related to builds with PHONON=0</li>
 	<li>fix: ROMAlyzer: after updating CHDs to the latest format, update the CHD header information from the replaced file before comparing the SHA1 checksums</li>
 	<li>fix: minor: corrected a few texts with regard to the current variant's emulator type (MAME vs. MESS)</li>
 	<li>fix: file-chooser: expand/collapse ZIP-contents on any type of 'activation' (i.e. not only on mouse double-clicks but also when enter or return are pressed, includes navigation via cursor-keys)</li>
 	<li>fix: re-enable 'locked' widgets when the emulator can't be started for reading the game/machine data</li>
 	<li>fix: MESS device configurator: corrected display of file-editor's data when there's only one available device instance (by synchronizing delegate/model updates)</li>
 	<li>fix: don't start a verification process when the ROM state cache can't be opened for writing</li>
 	<li>fix: file-chooser: the machine-dependent software-folder was not correctly pre-selected when existing device configurations were loaded in parallel</li>
 	<li>fix: MESS device configurator: avoid a rare crash when systems are hovered very quickly (asynchronous updates may otherwise work on meanwhile invalid data)</li>
 	<li>fix: clear favorites and play-history upon reload and make sure the last selected game/machine is correctly re-selected (if applicable)</li>
 	<li>fix: ROMAlyzer: when repairing a set and the wanted CRC or name (header-)entry already exists in the target ZIP, recreate the complete ZIP file in order to replace the 'bad' file</li>
 	<li>fix: ROMAlyzer: don't rewrite sets that are analyzed on behalf of the checksum-wizard (even if 'rewrite while analyzing' has been activated)</li>
 	<li>fix: corrected some additional MESS-specific phrases and removed WIP-only stuff from key- &amp; joystick-mappers</li>
 	<li>fix: adjusted the behavior of the two main search combo-boxes and tied them more closely</li>
 	<li>fix: software-lists: support <u>multiple</u> allowed device-interface types</li>
 	<li>fix: MiniWebBrowser: don't raise main-widget / lower browser window(s) when selecting the path to save a downloadable resource</li>
 	<li>fix: corrected character conversion when compressing HTML data stored in in-memory and on-disk web-caches (using QString::toLocal8Bit() instead of QString::toLatin1() now)</li>
 	<li>imp: ROMAlyzer: LRU-caching XML data positions in order to speed up merge-processing</li>
 	<li>imp: updated the MAME variant's logo with an improved version from JacKc</li>
 	<li>imp: MESS device configurator: log a warning when '-listslots' crashes</li>
 	<li>imp: MAME/MESS emulator templates updated to 0.146 (fixed duplication of option 'natural' in MESS templates)</li>
 	<li>imp: interpret the new 'has no roms' status as 'good' (a.k.a. correct)</li>
 	<li>imp: foreign emulator support: added $DESCRIPTION$ as an optional argument placeholder for the set's description</li>
 	<li>imp: ROMAlyzer: interpret emu- and file-states of sets that have no ROMs as 'good' also in case of MAME (new since 0.145u2)</li>
 	<li>imp: ROM status check: circumvent the corner case of sets without ROMs also in case of MAME (new since 0.145u2, see 'ide_baseboard' and 'hdd' devices)</li>
 	<li>imp: ROMAlyzer: log possible driver XML bugs where a merge-name is given without a parent set to take it from (other than this, these cases are ignored and treated as 'good' merge-states)</li>
 	<li>imp: when registering foreign emulators, the existence of the <i>$ID$</i> placeholder on the supplied command line is now indicated through a green/yellow colored label (when $ID$ is missing, the configuration will most likely not work)</li>
 	<li>imp: allow the specification of the emulator's working directory already in the welcome dialog</li>
 	<li>imp: updated redistributed Qt translations from Qt 4.8.1</li>
 	<li>imp: honor 'players' value for device sets where applicable (i.e. some input devices)</li>
 	<li>imp: MESS device configurator: sort slot-options alphanumerically, add a separator between 'not used' and available options, allow disabling of <i>default</i> slot-options and indicate them as such</li>
 	<li>imp: main widget: revised all auto-connected menu actions to use QAction::triggered(bool) (instead of a meanwhile deprecated signal)</li>
 	<li>imp: slightly better responsiveness while loading cached XML data</li>
 	<li>imp: Mac OS X build: avoid using xcodebuild for Qt 4.8+</li>
 	<li>imp: replaced the 'MESS wiki driver look-up' with a ProjectMESS-based search since most data in the MESS wiki was lost, and ProjectMESS is the new de-facto '#1 web-resource for all things MESS' :)</li>
 	<li>imp: the MiniWebBrowser's zoom-factor can now also be specified through a (mouse) wheel-event when the Ctrl-key is pressed at the same time (like most standalone browsers)</li>
 	<li>new: ROMAlyzer: added support for CHD v5 (new since MAME/MESS 0.145u1) -- built-in analysis will work for CHD v3, v4 and v5; however, note that all 'CHD manager' functionality <b>requires chdman from MAME/MESS 0.145u1+ now</b></li>
 	<li>new: ROMAlyzer: added a function to store the current log contents to a file</li>
 	<li>new: added tear-off capability to all menus within menu-bars</li>
 	<li>new: added freely customizable lists of game/machine IDs (and descriptions) that can be attached to foreign emulators and be presented / launched through the menu</li>
 	<li>new: both the MAWS (off-line) and the ProjectMESS driver look-up features save/restore their zoom-factors now</li>
 	<li>new: experimental support for Qt 5, which is in alpha-stage right now (there will be no embedder support on X11 platforms in the first place, since they dropped some X11-specific classes like the QX11EmbedContainer -- an add-on for Qt 5 to revive this functionality is planned, but will probably not be available before Qt 5.1)</li>
 	<li>new: YouTube video-player: you can now also 'paste' a YouTube video URL into the video-player itself, which will then start playing the respective video without attaching it to the play list</li>
 	<li>new: about dialog: added output of run-time Qt library paths to the system-information page</li>
 	<li>new: integrated zlib 1.2.6 to remove the extra requirement</li>
 	<li>new: the MiniWebBrowser now supports and allows pop-up window requests when the build option BROWSER_JAVASCRIPT is enabled (which is the default)</li>
 	<li>new: build option BROWSER_EXTRAS is now enabled by default which also activates the use of QtWebKit's <i>Web Inspector</i> in the MiniWebBrowser for everyone</li>
 	<li>new: added a Spanish translation -- thanks to <a href="credits.html#Daniel">Daniel Barrado</a></li>
 	<li>wip: adding a set rename tool to the ROMAlyzer which uses the -listxml outputs from both the old and the current emulator to gather the changes automagically</li>
 	<li>wip: adding a Romanian translation (mostly done) -- thanks to <a href="credits.html#Mihai">Mihai Boisteanu</a></li>
 	<li>wip: adding an Italian translation -- thanks to <a href="credits.html#Stefano">Stefano Cereda</a></li>
 	<li>wip: adding a stand-alone CHDMAN GUI (see tools/qchdman/)</li>
 	<li>wip: adding a Greek translation -- thanks to <a href="credits.html#Kostas">Kostas Albanidis</a></li>
 	<li>wip: adding a Swedish translation -- thanks to <a href="credits.html#DanielNylander">Daniel Nylander</a></li>
</ul>
<p><b>v0.35, 06-FEB-2012:</b></p>
<ul>
 	<li>fix: minor: hide the software-list favorites column 'device configuration' for MAME targets as it's a MESS-only feature</li>
 	<li>fix: minor: corrected the main progress-bar's visual behavior when ROM status checking and software-list caching are running in parallel</li>
 	<li>fix: MAME targets: the software-list widget wasn't cleared upon reload</li>
 	<li>fix: the last active detail-tab's header wasn't always shown initially</li>
 	<li>fix: software-snapshots were positioned incorrectly under certain circumstances</li>
 	<li>fix: corrected a few minor log-scrolling issues</li>
 	<li>fix: individual ROM checks didn't work correctly when the ROM status was 'not found' since output is written to stderr in this case and not to stdout as otherwise</li>
 	<li>fix: YouTube video-player: avoid crashes on exit by waiting for all application threads to finish before returning to the OS</li>
 	<li>fix: YouTube video-player: attached videos could get lost when changing the current game/machine very quickly</li>
 	<li>fix: ROMAlyzer: correctly 'remove' the progress-bar item-widget before deleting it (worked w/o until Qt 4.7.x, crashed since Qt 4.8.0)</li>
 	<li>fix: corrected restoration of main-widget's layout when the front-end was showing a maximized embedded emulator during clean up on the previous run</li>
 	<li>fix: corrected Windows 64-bit builds with DEBUG=2 (see <a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=21" target="_blank">BT #21</a>)</li>
 	<li>fix: file-chooser: the underlying item model now produces correct minimum widths for icon-less columns (size and modification date)</li>
 	<li>fix: embedder on X11: corrected initial input focus after launching a new embedded emulator</li>
 	<li>imp: ROM status exporter: additional output-format choice ('all formats') to export the ROM states to all three formats at once</li>
 	<li>imp: when a software-list can't be found (though it's expected to exist), leave the software-list widget disabled and don't try to parse the invalid XML (a warning will still be logged since this is actually an emulator bug, but probably also a wanted/known situation as told by <a href="http://forums.bannister.org/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showprofile&User=1564" target="_blank">etabeta78</a>)</li>
 	<li>imp: MAME/MESS emulator templates updated to 0.145</li>
 	<li>imp: faster display of software-snapshots by using tool-tip like window attributes for the viewer widget (this also fixes bad-window errors on X11)</li>
 	<li>imp: slightly bigger icons in all game/machine list views</li>
 	<li>imp: updated template format to v0.2.5 which adds support for an optional 'part' attribute that can be used in file-type options to specify the extracted part of the file's path (currently only "basename" is supported, used by the effect-option)</li>
 	<li>imp: loading of software-lists can be interrupted now and is indicated accordingly for larger lists (i.e. cpc_cass/cpc_flop)</li>
 	<li>imp: Mac OS X build: moved macx/Info.plist.in to arch/Darwin/Info.plist.in where it belongs</li>
 	<li>imp: build: added a 'configure' make target to create platform dependent project file(s) and stop (i.e. to open it in XCode and build from there on Mac OS X, or to run MinGW make in job-server mode on Windows)</li>
 	<li>imp: MiniWebBrowser: browser-plugins are now enabled by default (see make option <i>BROWSER_PLUGINS</i>)</li>
 	<li>imp: build: removed make option <i>PRETTY</i> as it's no longer usable in the supported Qt versions</li>
 	<li>imp: Mac OS X build: provide application icons (.icns) to be associated with the apps</li>
 	<li>imp: created new logo images (thanks to JacKc)</li>
 	<li>imp: ROMAlyzer: checksum-wizard: when the user changes the checksum-type and the current checksum is available in the 'other' type as well, display it in the line-edit (not available when the checksum is edited manually)</li>
 	<li>new: the ROM state filtering mechanism can now be enabled/disabled on-the-fly (the default is 'enabled', just as before)</li>
 	<li>new: added support for multi-device software-list entries as well as automatic vs. manual mount-device selection (includes the ability to mix parts from different software-list entries)</li>
 	<li>new: added an alternative game/machine search entry box to the tool-bar</li>
 	<li>new: added a CSV and ASCII export tool for software-lists</li>
 	<li>new: added import/export functionality for software-list <i>favorites</i></li>
 	<li>new: changed the MESS device configurator so it offers available device-instances based on the slot-options specified, thus allowing to <i>mount</i> them as well (through the legacy device-mapper and the file-chooser)</li>
 	<li>new: added ZIP support for software-snapshots</li>
 	<li>new: X11 and Windows only: game/machine icons are now also shown on the tab headers of embedded emulators</li>
 	<li>new: all images have an additional context-menu item ('refresh') now to clear and reload their cached pendants</li>
 	<li>new: integrated the HTML editor from <a href="http://qt.gitorious.org/qt-labs/graphics-dojo" target="_blank">Qt Labs / graphics-dojo</a> for all kinds of (upcoming) rich-text editing purposes</li>
 	<li>new: added content-zoom to the MiniWebBrowser</li>
 	<li>new: top-level windows can now optionally be minimized upon emulation launch and automatically restored when the (last) emulator instance has ended</li>
 	<li>new: YouTube video-player: added a semi-transparent overlay widget to display status information at the bottom of the player's viewport</li>
 	<li>new: software-lists: added software-compatibility filtering</li>
 	<li>new: added a 'MESS wiki' detail to look up available driver information</li>
 	<li>new: added an option to suppress all messages sent through QDebug and related convenience functions</li>
 	<li>new: added an optional startup splash-screen utilizing the new logos</li>
 	<li>new: added support for emulator-embedding on Windows (!) -- note, however, that embedding of emulators running in <i>Direct 3D</i> mode ('-video d3d') has two known issues: full-screen switching will lead to a crash (of the emulator) and screen-shots aren't taken correctly from within the GUI (just a black image)</li>
 	<li>new: X11 and Windows only: added an option to select the <i>default launch-mode</i> used when starting emulation by <i>activating</i> (i.e. double-clicking) an entry in any list</li>
 	<li>new: X11 and Windows only: replaced the style-controlled embedder-release icons (usually a red 'X' which some users wrongly interpreted as 'exit emulator') with a more suitable / less irritating and style-independent icon by setting explicit style-sheets on the tab-bars of all embedders</li>
 	<li>new: added two options to allow for hiding of BIOS and/or device sets in all master-lists (see <i>Front end</i> -&gt; <i>Game/Machine list</i> in the main setup dialog) -- both will trigger an automatic reload when changed</li>
 	<li>new: added a dock-able/floating software-detail widget with a separate snapshot-browser, a <a href="http://www.progettoemma.net/mess/" target="_blank">ProjectMESS</a> software-lookup feature, and an HTML editor/viewer for personal rich-text software-notes</li>
 	<li>inf: <b>the new required minimum Qt version is 4.7.0</b>, support for older versions of Qt has been dropped</li>
</ul>
<p><b>v0.34, 15-NOV-2011:</b></p>
<ul>
 	<li>fix: MAME targets: don't auto-resize the last column in the game/machine list views when toggling the use of catver.ini (it annoys more than it helps)</li>
 	<li>fix: build: corrected compile-time bugs related to builds with PHONON=0</li>
 	<li>fix: adjust icon sizes when showing the audio-effect dialog initially</li>
 	<li>fix: removed flicker on changing game-/machine-list views</li>
 	<li>fix: corrected a few MESS-specific phrases</li>
 	<li>fix: corrected delegate-sizing issues when there's only one device instance in the MESS device setup</li>
 	<li>fix: Mac OS X: set ROMAlyzer's parent widget in order to avoid context-menu displacement</li>
 	<li>fix: ROMAlyzer: the ROM set's context-menu should be available also when the set rewriter hasn't been enabled</li>
 	<li>fix: MAME targets: category- and version-views were not created initially when switched to via the view-selector combo-box</li>
 	<li>fix: MAME targets: demo-mode: avoid floating-point exception when no games were selected by the filter</li>
 	<li>imp: updated minizip to version 1.01h</li>
 	<li>imp: YouTube video player: decode (percent-)encoded error messages before logging them</li>
 	<li>imp: setup dialog: conflated all formerly split emulator- and game-info DB settings</li>
 	<li>imp: MAME/MESS emulator templates updated to 0.144</li>
 	<li>imp: ROMAlyzer: better 'no dump' indication</li>
 	<li>imp: enabled audio-effect widgets for MinGW builds (they work fine when the <b>official</b> Qt DLLs are being used, otherwise set the new <i>AUDIOEFFECTDIALOGS</i> make option to 0 in order to disable them)</li>
 	<li>imp: X11 only: minor embedder optimizations regarding widget resizing</li>
 	<li>imp: YouTube video player: added support for YouTube's new way of presenting video stream URLs</li>
 	<li>imp: general overhaul of the main-widget's layout parameters to allow for a somewhat more 'compact' design</li>
 	<li>imp: the working directory of the external ROM tool can be specified now</li>
 	<li>imp: build: added <i>EMU</i> as an alias for the <i>EMULATOR</i> make option</li>
 	<li>imp: locale-aware statistics in the ROM status exporter and the GUI's ROM status bar</li>
 	<li>imp: updated redistributed Qt translations from Qt 4.7.4</li>
 	<li>new: added a 'driver status' column to all game/machine lists (or views)</li>
 	<li>new: Windows only: the <i>other</i> variant's exe file can now be specified explicitly (the default is to search for it only in the directory where the calling variant was started from) -- this works also when you rename the exe files; you can additionally specify the command line arguments passed to the <i>other</i> variant (note that this is an independent setting and would also be used when the variant exe is not overwritten!)</li>
 	<li>new: support for MAME's/MESS's new device-referencing (new since 0.143u2+ SVN)</li>
 	<li>new: Mac OS X only: the tool-bar can now optionally be unified with the title-bar</li>
 	<li>new: MESS targets: support for machine-specific device slots / slot options, integrated with the MESS device configurator</li>
 	<li>new: the MESS variants now use their own logo, and all variants use new unified applications icons -- thanks to <a href="http://forums.bannister.org/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showprofile&User=3340" target="_blank">Anna Wu</a></li>
 	<li>new: added a new tool-function to allow for forced removal of ALL emulator related caches at once</li>
 	<li>new: added support for the new 'messinfo.dat' file from AntoPISA (see <a href="http://www.progettosnaps.net/messinfo/" target="_blank">http://www.progettosnaps.net/messinfo/</a>)</li>
 	<li>new: completed the support for software-lists in MAME and MESS (ZIP-support for software-snaps will be added later)</li>
 	<li>new: customizable columns in all game-/machine-list and software-list views</li>
 	<li>new: MESS targets: a new 'file chooser' dialog has been added to the MESS device configurator as an easy-to-use alternative to the manual setup</li>
 	<li>new: MESS targets: device type icons are now displayed to better symbolize MESS device instances</li>
 	<li>new: ROMAlyzer: you can specify an additional source ROM path for the set rewriter in order to allow for merging updates</li>
 	<li>new: added support for <i>item-tagging</i> and a number of related operations that can now also be performed for tagged games/machines</li>
 	<li>new: for ZIP-archived icons (actually the only practical way to store them) support for ICO format has been added -- this means that for instance <a href="http://icons.mameworld.info/" target="_blank">MAMU's icon</a> can now be used directly, w/o conversion to PNGs!</li>
 	<li>new: icons are now also supported for all MESS targets</li>
 	<li>wip: adding a Java (Eclipse/SWT) based editor/translator for emulator templates (see <i>tools/qmc2_options_editor_java</i>) -- thanks to <a href="credits.html#Marcelo">Marcelo Bossoni</a></li>
 	<li>inf: note that <b>the versioning pattern has changed</b>: we now just count the releases and follow the simple scheme '0.XX', where XX is the release number</li>
 	<li>inf: note that <b>the minimum required MESS revision now is SVN r12599</b> (or MESS 0.143u3)</li>
