<h3><a name="1."></a>1. What is the M.A.M.E. Catalog / Launcher II?</h3>
<p><i>M.A.M.E. Catalog / Launcher II</i> - also referred to as <i>QMC2</i> - is the successor of one of the first UNIX M.A.M.E. GUI front ends available on this planet called <i>QMamecat</i> (derived from <i>MAMECAT</i>, which was text-only). QMamecat was based upon Qt 2; its development was frozen in 2003.</p>
<p>By the beginning of March 2006, we started to build QMC2 from scratch as a Qt 4 project. Parts of the design and code were inspired by its predecessor, but it's not just a remake. We tried to make the new design as flexible as possible to minimize dependencies from front end and CLI related MAME changes, which was a major deficiency of QMamecat. QMC2 now uses a template based emulator configuration scheme, which can easily be enhanced with additional command line options (defined in an XML template file).</p>
<p>As a result of this flexible design and countless hours of work, QMC2 today is not only a stable, feature-rich and fast multi-platform GUI front-end for M.A.M.E. but also a fully-featured ROM manager for this emulator (and its derivatives, older versions of MAME or even foreign emulators when they use the same/similar XML syntax) through the built-in <i>ROMAlyzer</i>.</p>
<p>See the incomplete <a href="http://wiki.batcom-it.net/index.php?title=About_QMC2#Features" target="_blank">feature list</a> for more details.</p>
<h3><a name="2."></a>2. Build and installation instructions</h3>
<p>Please see <a href="http://wiki.batcom-it.net/index.php?title=The_%27ultimate%27_guide_to_QMC2#Building_and_installing_QMC2_from_source" target="_blank">this section in the QMC2 wiki</a> and/or
<a href="http://wiki.batcom-it.net/index.php?title=QMC2_FAQ#Build_and_installation_instructions_for_specific_distributions" target="_blank">this FAQ</a> for build and installation instructions.</p>
<h3><a name="3."></a>3. Command line arguments and configuration</h3>
<p>Usage example (for Linux/UNIX and Mac OS X, the binary is called <code>qmc2-mame.exe</code> on Windows):</p>
<pre>$ qmc2-sdlmame [-config_path &lt;path&gt;] [-cc] [-tc] [-r] [-h|-?|-help] [qt_arguments]</pre>
<p>
Arguments in detail:
<ul>
  <li><i>-config_path</i>: See <a href="#config_path">configuration path</a> below!</li>
  <li><i>-cc</i>: This command line option will instruct QMC2 to clear (remove) all emulator related cache files while starting up in order to forcibly reload this data from the emulator.</li>
  <li><i>-tc</i>: Specifying this option on the command line will perform a template check against the current default emulator (if set), printing its output to stdout, and exit before actual start-up occurs.</li>
  <li><i>-r</i>: The <i>reconfigure</i> option will rerun the setup wizard / welcome dialog before starting. This allows you to update or correct the most important emulator settings in an easy way.</li>
  <li><i>-h|-?|-help</i>: Shows a brief command line usage help.</li>
  <li><i>qt_arguments</i>: See the <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qapplication.html#QApplication" target="_blank">QApplication class reference</a> for details on what Qt arguments are available (note, however, that some of these arguments are useless since QMC2 will overwrite them with its saved ini-settings).</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><a name="config_path"></a><b>Configuration path</b></p>
<p>When the <i>-config_path</i> option is specified on the command line, QMC2 will use this directory instead of the default 'dot-path' (see <a href="#config_notes">configuration notes</a> below).
Note that it's in your responsibility to copy/move the data to its desired place prior to starting QMC2 when this option is set, otherwise QMC2 will start over (which may be wanted behavior, though). Also, any settings
that may have inherited the previous dot-path will have to be changed manually (probably by editing qmc2.ini, but take care).</p>
<p><a name="config_notes"><b>Notes on the configuration of QMC2</b></p>
<p>UNIX and Mac OS X:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The user's configuration file will be stored as <i>~/.qmc2/qmc2.ini</i> on UNIX, or as <i>~/Library/Application Support/qmc2/qmc2.ini</i> on Mac OS X.</li>
  <li>A system-wide default configuration can be used to pre-configure QMC2 for your users (common paths: <i>/etc/qmc2/qmc2.ini</i> on UNIX, or <i>/Library/Application Support/qmc2/qmc2.ini</i> on Mac OS X).</li>
</ul>
<p>Windows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The user's configuration file will be stored as <i>%USERPROFILE%\.qmc2\qmc2.ini</i> on Windows.</li>
  <li>A system-wide default configuration for all users isn't supported (yet).</li>
  <li>All paths need to be specified <i>POSIX-like</i>, that is backslashes ("\", Windows) become slashes ("/", POSIX) within QMC2 --
      so don't be surprised when you see paths like <i>C:/some/directory</i> (instead of <i>C:\some\directory</i>) in QMC2,
      because that's how it's supposed to look like :)! The only exception is the command displayed on the emulator control panel
      (and in the front end log) because it may be copied to clipboard and reused on the command line directly (which wouldn't work with
      slashes in path names).</li>
</ul>
<p>All platforms:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If no configuration can be found for a specific option, hard-coded default values will be used for all front end settings (see code);
      default values for the emulator configuration are read from the current XML template (default paths: <i>/usr/local/share/qmc2/opt/&lt;EMULATOR&gt;/template.xml</i>
      on UNIX, <i>/Library/Application Support/qmc2/opt/&lt;EMULATOR&gt;/template.xml</i> on Mac OS X, and <i>data\opt\&lt;EMULATOR&gt;\template.xml</i> on Windows).</li>
  <li>If the path to the emulator's executable file has not been set (yet), QMC2 will assume that you are starting it for the first time
      (your setup is considered <i>incomplete</i> as long as this option hasn't been set).</li>
  <li>Although it is recommended to edit the configuration with the built-in setup dialog, you may change it manually with
      any editor at your own risk -- only do this if QMC2 is <b>not</b> currently running, though!</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="4."></a>4. Machine list statistics, ROM status and the ROMAlyzer</h3>
<p>Machine list statistics are shown in the lower-left corner of the main widget, below the machine list.
The letters - and their colors - have the following meanings:

  </tbody>
</table>
<font size="-1"><sup>*</sup>: These numbers are only available when the ROM state has been checked.</font>
<p>If any statistical number is yet undetermined, a question mark (?) is shown instead.</p>
<p>Individual ROM states are displayed in the machine list itself, indicated by colored sphere icons
in front of each machine entry (see table above). When using the <i>classic</i> image set, BIOS ROMs will contain a white <b>B</b>
in their ROM status icons. Device ROMs contain a white <b>D</b> and cannot run standalone. Other (= non-default) image sets may indicate BIOS and device ROMs differently.</p>
<p>Depending on your hardware, ROM status determination may be a very time-consuming task, so it's not started automatically.
You have to explicitly trigger a ROM check (see <i>Tools</i> menu) at least once. To speed up this process for future runs, ROM states
are cached in an external <i>ROM state cache</i> file (default: <i>~/.qmc2/&lt;emulator&gt;.rsc</i> on UNIX, <i>~/Library/Application Support/qmc2/&lt;emulator&gt;.rsc</i> on Mac OS X,
or <i>%USERPROFILE%\.qmc2\&lt;emulator&gt;.rsc</i> on Windows). If QMC2 finds cached ROM state information in this file, it will read the states for each machine from the cache
when the machine list is reloaded.</p>
<p>Unless the option <i>AutoTriggerROMCheck</i> hasn't been activated, it is in your responsibility to trigger a re-check of the ROM states when anything changes (ROM images or
MAME updates). If the number of totally supported machines (by the emulator) is different than the number of cached ROM states, QMC2 will log a warning to the front end log
(and optionally trigger an automatic ROM check, if <i>AutoTriggerROMCheck</i> has been set).</p>
<p>QMC2 also supports individual ROM checks, so changes to only <i>some</i> machines of your collection do not force you to fully re-check every ROM.
For MAME updates there's probably no way around it, though (unless you know which machines have changed or have been added).</p>
<p>ROM states can be used to filter and/or sort the detailed machine list (a.k.a. the <i>master list</i>). Please note that as a matter of principle
the ROM state filter can't be applied to the hierarchical parent/clone view of the machine list, because the display of clones depends on the display
of their parents. The optional views 'by version' and 'by category' (which are only available when the use of <a href="http://www.progettoemma.net/?catlist" target="_blank">catver.ini</a>
and/or <i>MESS category.ini</i> has been enabled) are also not filtered.</p>
<p><b>ROMAlyzer</b></p>
<p>Since v0.2.b1, there is also a so called <i>ROMAlyzer</i> which allows to deeply scan individual (or multiple) machines for their exact ROM state. This work was inspired by <a href="credits.html#Carsten">Carsten Engel's</a> romalyzer.pl Perl script (see scripts/romalyzer.pl in the source distribution) - he also offered very helpful comments on ROM identification and how to handle CHDs. Thanks!</p>
Please refer to the <a href="http://wiki.batcom-it.net/index.php?title=The_%27ultimate%27_guide_to_QMC2#Analyzing_sets_with_the_ROMAlyzer" target="_blank">ROMAlyzer section in our wiki</a> for detailed information! 
<h3><a name="5."></a>5. Short cuts, GUI control keys and joystick support</h3>
<p>Many functions in QMC2 can be accessed via short cut key-sequences which can be remapped freely. See <a href="http://wiki.batcom-it.net/index.php?title=The_%27ultimate%27_guide_to_QMC2#Key_sequences_.2F_short_cuts" target="_blank">this section in our wiki</a> for a list of the available short cuts and their default key sequences.</p>
<p>Beside this list, remapping includes some special keys (like all cursor keys, page up/down, tab, +/-, ...) that are required for GUI control through key-strokes. The ability to remap key sequences should be very handy for users of MAME cabinets with sticks that map their controls to key-strokes (X-Arcade controls for example). Of course, we hope it's useful for others as well :).</p>
<p><b>Joystick control</b></p>
<p>For users of (regular) analog or digital joysticks, there is direct support for joystick GUI control through SDL (Simple Directmedia Layer) since v0.2.b3. Simply enable joystick support on the respective configuration page, map any of the above functions or GUI control keys to joystick functions and you can start using a stick to control QMC2 right away.</p>
<p>Internally, joystick functions are mapped to active keyboard short cuts and/or GUI control keys. The corresponding key presses are emulated in software as soon as a mapped joystick function is recognized. This means that using a joystick to control the GUI will cause some additional events, but it doesn't hurt.</p>
<p>Key events for joystick mappings will always be sent to the widget which currently has focus, but <u>only</u> if the widget is one of QMC2. All other cases will be ignored, which means that it does not influence the emulator (or vice versa), although QMC2 still recognizes the joystick movements, button presses etc... it will just not react on them while the emulator (or any other application) has focus.</p>
<p>However, there are two exceptions to this rule:</p>
<ul>
	<li>For embedded emulators, mixing / sharing the joystick control between QMC2 and an emulator is <b>not supported</b> (well, <i>not recommended</i>)</li>
	<li>When QMC2 is in joystick test- or calibration-mode, it will not only receive all joystick events, but also react on them with widget updates. This is not really a problem and could be used for debugging purposes, but should normally be avoided because it eats some CPU cycles for no real use.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="6."></a>6. External tools and tool argument syntax</h3>
<p>External tools are used for specific operations which aren't natively built into QMC2.</p>
<p>For instance, to remove obsolete or corrupt image files from ZIP or 7z archives, QMC2 uses an external program (zip or 7za) and passes the files to be removed on the argument list when the tool is started.</p>
<p>A third and more <i>generic</i> tool - the so called <i>ROM tool</i> - can be used to call any program or script which does some external processing based on the machine's ID and/or its long name (description). It's completely up to you what this tool might do... ideally, it should have some ROM management / ROM related functionality, though :).</p> 
<p>Tools can have a single function or they can have multiple functions. For each function, an argument list has to be specified which defines the correct syntax for the command. Macros (like <i>$MACRONAME$</i>) can be used as placeholders and will be filled with <i>real</i> data before execution.</p>
<p>The following macros exist:</p>
<table style="text-align: left;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
  <tbody>
    <tr bgcolor="#101010">
      <td style="vertical-align: top; font-weight: bold;"><font color="white">Macro</font></td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top; font-weight: bold;"><font color="white">Will be replaced with...</font></td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top; font-weight: bold;"><font color="white">Valid tools</font></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">$ARCHIVE$</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">... the currently processed ZIP or 7z archive's file name (fully qualified)</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Zip tool, 7-zip tool</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">$FILELIST$</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">... the currently processed list of files ("file1 file2 ..." - fully qualified)</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Zip tool, 7-zip tool</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">$ID$</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">... the ID of the currently selected machine</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">ROM tool</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">$DESCRIPTION$</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">... the long name (or description) of the currently selected machine</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">ROM tool</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Everything else will be passed as <i>literal text</i> at the position where it's specified (see <i>Front end</i> -&gt; <i>Network / Tools</i> in the setup dialog).</p>
<p>When external tools are started by QMC2, a simple tool-executor dialog will pop up to display the command and its output.</p>
<h3><a name="7."></a>7. Multi-platform support</h3>
<p>As the front end code has been designed with portability in mind, QMC2 should work on any UNIX or UNIX-like
platform, on Mac OS X and meanwhile also on Windows, provided Qt 4 and (SDL)MAME are supported on this platform as well.</p>
<p>
However, you may have to create or adopt the corresponding OS-specific configuration file, which is
<span style="font-style: italic;">arch/`uname`.cfg</span>. If it does not exist nor fit your local situation, the build
will most likely fail:</p>
<pre>$ make ARCH=test<br>ls: arch/test.cfg: No such file or directory<br>Qmake version: 1.07a (Qt 3.3.7)<br>Qmake is free software from Trolltech AS.<br>Error: Wrong QMake version. QMake version 2 (Qt 4) required!</pre>
<p>Note that by using the <span style="font-style: italic;">ARCH</span>-variable
on the make command line, you could easily specify a <span style="font-style: italic;">local</span>
configuration, even if a system configuration file already exists for your platform. Take the
one that comes nearest to your system configuration and change it to your needs.</p>
<p>Since v0.1.b10, there's an alternative method which will help to solve distribution-specific build problems.
Let's say you wanted to use the Qt 4 packages provided by your distribution and you know that the version is
sufficient. So, instead of just considering <i>Linux</i> as the OS name (or <i>architecture</i>), also consider
the local differences of this type of setup:<p>
<pre>$ make DISTCFG=1</pre>
<p>If make is called this way, the QMC2 build process will try to figure out what the exact name and release of your
OS / distribution is. It will load the OS-specific configuration just as before (i.e. <i>arch/Linux.cfg</i>), but it will overwrite
the OS configuration settings with the distribution-specific configuration settings (i.e. <i>arch/Linux/openSUSE_10.3.cfg</i> in case of an openSUSE 10.3 installation).
This means that only differences to the global OS configuration need to be placed in this file.<p>
<p>Of course, this mechanism requires that a specific configuration file for your OS / distribution exists. If not, the build
will fail. Create the required file (see output from <i>make</i> or run <i>make os-detect</i> to figure out the expected name of the
configuration file) and try again!<p>
<p>In case of any trouble, feel free to contact us (see <a href="#8.">section 8.</a>). Please attach the output of <code>make os-detect</code> in this case!</p>
<p>Also, please send us your configuration file if you try QMC2 on other platforms / distributions than the ones included in the <code>arch/</code> or <code>arch/&lt;os-name&gt;/</code> directories. Regardless if you are successful or not, any help is greatly appreciated (see <a href="#9.">section 9.</a>).</p>
