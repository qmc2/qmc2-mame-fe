<h3>TODO - v0.55, 26-AUG-2015</h3>
<p><b>Known bugs and restrictions</b></p>
<ul>
 	<li>The built-in joystick GUI control includes support for trackballs -- this is completely untested due to the lack of controllers with trackballs (it should basically work, but be prepared for bugs and unexpected behavior).</li>
 	<li>On X11 platforms, the QMC2 variant launcher will try to raise a probably already running <i>other</i> variant -- this feature is <b>very</b> dependent on the window manager which may decide to ignore XMapRaised().</li>
 	<li>MAME output notifiers are not supported on Windows yet.</li>
 	<li>The built-in <i>MiniWebBrowser</i> has a fairly restrictive set of features which is tailored to the uses of QMC2. It's not even <i>meant</i> to be a full-featured browser, even though it meanwhile supports most of the typical browser-functions.</li>
 	<li>Depending on the complexity of a style / style sheet combination, it may slow down GUI operations (that's no bug, but you should note it).</li>
 	<li>The ROMAlyzer's <i>set rewriter</i> feature doesn't support reproduction of 7z archives (yet), only ZIPs or <i>regular files</i> in individual sub-directores can be created.</li> 
 	<li>Due to a Qt restriction, a QTabWidget's corner-widget (if any) is only shown when the tab-position is either <i>north</i> or <i>south</i>.</li>
 	<li>X11: Embedded emulators that change their display sizes at runtime (usually during startup) may not always be centered correctly. Unfortunately, newer window-managers may cause additional problems with resizing. We hope that we can avoid all of this with our planned embedder port to Qt 5.</li>
 	<li>Windows: There's a known issue for <u>embedded</u> emulators running in <i>Direct 3D</i> mode ('-video d3d'): full-screen switching will lead to a crash of the emulator. To work around this, you have to <i>release</i> the emulator first; you can re-embed it later from the emulator control panel.</li>
 	<li>Windows: MinGW builds: The GIF animation used when loading / filtering the machine list (or when <i>mass tagging</i> sets) isn't displayed in case of MinGW builds. We have no idea why, nor do we think it's our fault since in the official binaries built with VC++ this works fine (seems to be a MinGW-specific Qt bug). However, it's just a 'cosmetic' issue.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Planned changes, new features and improvements</b></p>
<ul>
 	<li>Fulfill the accepted/open <a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/search.php?project_id=1&category=Feature%20requests&status_id=50&sticky_issues=off&sortby=last_updated&dir=DESC&hide_status_id=-2&match_type=0" target="_blank">feature requests from our bug-tracker</a> (see also our <a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/roadmap_page.php?project_id=1" target="_blank">current roadmap</a>)</li>
 	<li>Create a Qt 5 specific embedder (platform-independent with regard to embed handling, so will hopefully also work on Mac OS X)</li>
 	<li>Add support for MAME's HTTP web-console &amp; JSON interface (note: Qt 4.8.x needs a newer QtWebKit to support <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455" target="_blank">RFC 6455</a>, it only comes with support for the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hixie-thewebsocketprotocol-76" target="_blank">hixie-76</a> draft version of the WebSocket protocol, so this might be no option - QtWebKit in Qt 5.1.x has support for this, though)</li>
 	<li>Add a nicer <i>quick-search</i> function (replacing the default keyboard-search implementation inherited from QAbstractItemView) to all 4 machine list views and the software-list view including a pop-up editor to display and customize the search string</li>
 	<li>Add an optional reg-exp filtered machine list view (as an advanced alternative to the search feature)</li>
 	<li>Add software-state info to the software-list export feature</li>
 	<li>Add support for <b>multiple</b> images per image category</li>
 	<li>Add support for optional coloring of some machine list item cells, especially for the driver status column</li>
 	<li>Add support for launching emulators in record &amp; playback modes (input recording/playback)</li>
 	<li>Add a backup / restore tool for QMC2's configuration and caches (though it's a trivial task, see <a href="http://wiki.batcom-it.net/index.php?title=QMC2_FAQ#How_do_I_backup_.2F_restore_QMC2.27s_configuration.3F" target="_blank">this FAQ</a> and/or <a href="http://wiki.batcom-it.net/index.php?title=The_%27ultimate%27_guide_to_QMC2#Configuration_backup_.2F_restore" target="_blank">this section in the wiki</a>)</li>
 	<li>Add export / import functionality for YouTube video attachments (to allow for merging of videos found by different people, or to backup / restore discovered videos)</li>
 	<li>Add a high-score database</li>
 	<li>Add a joystick &amp; keyboard configurator for MAME</li>
 	<li>Add support for MAME output notifications on Windows</li>
 	<li>Create an improved setup wizard with QWizard</li>
</ul>
