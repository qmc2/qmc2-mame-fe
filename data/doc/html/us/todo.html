<h3>TODO - v0.193, 01-DEC-2017</h3>
<p><b>Known bugs and restrictions</b></p>
<ul>
 	<li>The built-in joystick GUI control includes support for trackballs -- this is completely untested due to the lack of controllers with trackballs (it should basically work, but be prepared for bugs and unexpected behavior).</li>
 	<li>The built-in <i>MiniWebBrowser</i> has a fairly restrictive set of features which is tailored to the uses of QMC2. It's not even <i>meant</i> to be a full-featured browser, even though it meanwhile supports most of the typical browser-functions.</li>
 	<li>Depending on the complexity of a style / style sheet combination, it may slow down GUI operations (that's no bug, but you should note it).</li>
 	<li>Due to a Qt restriction, a QTabWidget's corner-widget (if any) is only shown when the tab-position is either <i>north</i> or <i>south</i>.</li>
 	<li>X11 and Windows: When emulators are <i>embedded</i>, switching to full-screen (i.e. by pressing <code>Alt+Enter</code>) may lead to a crash of the emulator. To work around this, you have to <b>release</b> the emulator first; you can re-embed it later from the emulator control panel (when back in <i>windowed</i> mode). Also, the emulator's window caption is expected to start with the string "MAME:" in order to be found (so only <u>regular</u> MAME builds will work here!).</li>
 	<li>Windows: MinGW builds: The GIF animation used when loading / filtering the machine- or software-list, or when <i>mass tagging</i> sets, isn't displayed in case of MinGW builds. We have no idea why, nor do we think it's our fault since in the official binaries built with VC++ this works fine (seems to be a MinGW-specific Qt bug). However, it's just a 'cosmetic' issue.</li>
	<li>The ROMAlyzer's analyzer and set-rewriter features do not support individual dumps that are larger than 2 GB (due to a QByteArray limitation) and will skip them to avoid a crash. However, the newer collection rebuilder (sub-)feature handles such dumps cleanly (since QMC2 0.186).</li>
	<li>Windows: The internal / built-in PDF viewer (PDF.js based) somehow doesn't work at all on Windows. If we don't find an easy fix it may be removed completely (supporting only an external PDF viewer, that is).</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Planned changes, new features and improvements</b></p>
<ul>
 	<li>Fulfill the accepted/open <a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/search.php?project_id=1&category=Feature%20request&status_id=50&sticky_issues=off&sortby=last_updated&dir=DESC&hide_status_id=-2&match_type=0" target="_blank">feature requests from our bug-tracker</a> (see also our <a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/roadmap_page.php?project_id=1" target="_blank">current roadmap</a>)</li>
 	<li>Create a Qt 5 specific embedder (platform-independent with regard to embed handling, so will hopefully also work on Mac OS X)</li>
 	<li>Add software-state info to the software-list export feature</li>
 	<li>Add support for <b>multiple</b> images per image category</li>
 	<li>Add support for optional coloring of some machine list item cells, especially for the driver status column</li>
 	<li>Add a joystick &amp; keyboard configurator for MAME</li>
</ul>
