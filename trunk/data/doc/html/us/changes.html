<p><b>v0.2.b15, 14-MAY-2010:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>fix: correctly change the view menu's and game list tab's icons when the view is selected via the combo box under the game/machine list</li>
  <li>fix: ROMAlyzer (cosmetic): forcedly update the result tree widget after each individual analysis (circumvents rare update issues when the ROMAlyzer isn't the <i>active</i> window)</li>
  <li>fix: correctly honor the escape key in the global emulator options when its temporary search widget is hidden (i.e. cancel/close the setup dialog instead of eating the key press)</li>
  <li>imp: SDLMESS/MESS templates updated to 0.137 (new/changed options <i>debug_internal</i>, <i>natural</i> and <i>uimodekey</i>)</li>
  <li>imp: SDLMAME/MAME/MAMEUIFX32 templates updated to 0.137u4 (no new or changed options)</li>
  <li>new: added boolean option <i>PlayOnSublistActivation</i> to interprete item activations in search-, favorites- and played-lists as <i>start playing</i> commands instead of jumping to the game/machine list (default: false, current behavior)</li>
  <li>new: added a new <i>ROM types</i> column to all game/machine lists and the ROM status exporter (the game/machine list cache will be updated automatically)</li>
  <li>new: the exit/stop action now blinks when there's background activity, giving better indication of the activity itself as well as the action's second function (<i>stop all current activity</i>)</li>
  <li>new: MAME targets only: added optional support for catver.ini from <a href="http://www.progettoemma.net/?catlist" target="_blank">http://www.progettoemma.net/?catlist</a>; this includes standard game list integration as well as two new views (view by game category / view by emulator version the game was added)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>v0.2.b14, 12-MAR-2010:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>fix: MAME/MAMEUIFX32 templates: corrected default value for <i>audio_latency</i>, added new option <i>numprocessors</i></li>
  <li>fix: build: disabling joystick support caused compilation errors -- thanks to <a href="credits.html#Marcelo">Marcelo Bossoni</a> for reporting the issue</li>
  <li>fix: corrected a set of initial setup issues (when there's no valid user-scope configuration for the respective QMC2 variant)</li>
  <li>fix: corrected template checking for default values containing white-space (bug tracker ID #11)</li>
  <li>fix: after checking icons, widget updates to the detailed game/machine list were disabled -- thanks to <a href="credits.html#Robert">Robert Hamberger</a> for reporting the issue</li>
  <li>fix: the game/machine list header's sort indicator wasn't correctly shown when the load process finished</li>
  <li>fix: corrected the MP3 player's internal state handling</li>
  <li>fix: avoid crashes when switching style sheets on-the-fly</li>
  <li>fix: avoid auto-scrolling of any game-/machine-list when returning from an embedded emulator</li>
  <li>fix: prevent the menu-bar's context menu from being displayed (it may irritate the user that settings made through it aren't (re)stored)</li>
  <li>fix: corrected full screen restoration on startup for desktops with multiple screens</li>
  <li>imp: the search pattern combo box is now part of the search tab widget (which appears more intuitive and leaves vertical space for better uses)</li>
  <li>imp: delaying initial main widget updates until all basic initializations &amp; GUI reconstructions are finished</li>
  <li>imp: added distribution-specific package specs to the source tree (see directory <i>pkg-specs/</i>)</li>
  <li>imp: delaying automatically triggered ROM checks for 250ms (in the hope it avoids rare crashes on slower systems)</li>
  <li>imp: nice performance improvements for ROM state filtering and loading of cached data (ROM state cache, game/machine list cache and XML cache)</li>
  <li>imp: SDLMAME/MAME/MAMEUIFX32 templates updated to 0.137 (new options <i>debug_internal</i>, <i>natural</i> and <i>uimodekey</i>)</li>
  <li>imp: SDLMESS/MESS templates updated to 0.136 (new option <i>numprocessors</i>)</li>
  <li>imp: embedder snapshot tool: positioning the snapshot viewer more intelligently, scaling the snapshot preview down to 50% of the captured size (if its size is larger than the native resolution)</li>
  <li>imp: build: QTDIR is no longer used -- use QMAKE instead, which defaults to <i>qmake</i> (that is, the qmake command found in $PATH)</li>
  <li>imp: added new alternative image sets <i>circles</i> and <i>cubes</i> (95% the same as the <i>classic</i> image set, except the colored spheres are replaced with styled circles / cubes)</li>
  <li>imp: embedder: show a message box and let the user decide if to retry an embedding operation if a window ID couldn't be found but the corresponding emulator was active at that time</li>
  <li>imp: honoring desktop/screen geometry limits when positioning context menus</li>
  <li>imp: setting the <i>update delay</i> to 'none' (0) will now cause synchronous updates when the game/machine selection changes; values higher than 0 will cause asynchronous updates just as before</li>
  <li>imp: embedder snapshot tool: by default, take snapshots in the game's/machine's native resolution</li>
  <li>imp: build: added the new make option <i>L_FLAGS</i> to pass additional flags to the linker</li>
  <li>new: embedder: added a toggle switch for automatic horizontal maximization of embedded emulator windows</li>
  <li>new: ROMAlyzer: CHD manager integration for optional deep verification (+ fixing) and automatic updates of CHDs -- caution: create backups before enabling the CHD manager!</li>
  <li>new: the main widget's <i>splitters</i> now have their own context menus to allow for orientation flipping and swapping of their sub-widgets/sub-layouts -- this allows a free (to a certain extent) layout of all major widgets!</li>
  <li>new: embedder: the embedder options toggle button now also includes a drop down menu (opened after a short delay when the button is held down) to terminate/kill the emulator or to add the game/machine to the favorites list (more actions may follow perhaps)</li>
  <li>new: MAME targets only: added a demo mode which runs random games from the overall list (filtered by ROM state) for a selectable period of time -- this has been requested by some MAME cabinet users for whom it may be useful</li>
  <li>doc: added <a href="faq.html#A3.6">Q3.6</a> and <a href="faq.html#A2.13">Q2.13</a> to FAQ</li>
</ul>
<p><b>v0.2.b13, 02-JAN-2010:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>fix: minor: use reverse order when loading translators (first load the Qt translations, then QMC2's translations -- Qt searches the loaded translations in reverse order, that is QMC2's translation will now be used with higher precedence)</li>
  <li>fix: disable MAWS cache directory browse button during reload</li>
  <li>fix: worked around a Qt bug that inhibits font changes through QApplication::setFont() when a style sheet is active</li>
  <li>fix: restored forced backround widget updates for Qt versions &gt;= 4.5.3 (MAWS quick links feature), delaying it to allow Qt to process all pending events (not perfect: may flicker)</li>
  <li>fix: hide the MAWS quick links button when its menu is (auto-)hidden and the mouse cursor has left the browser widget in the meantime</li>
  <li>fix: corrected minor focus issues after game/machine list reload</li>
  <li>fix: MAWS lookup: don't try to download the startup URL when we're offline</li>
  <li>fix: audio player: initially scroll playlist to the track last played (if any)</li>
  <li>fix: using update() wherever repaint() was used to redraw game/machine images (among other things, this corrects some long-standing minor item selection issues)</li>
  <li>imp: build: added a build configuration file for NetBSD (see arch/NetBSD.cfg) -- thanks to J&uuml;rgen Buchm&uuml;ller for testing QMC2 in this environment and reporting his results</li>
  <li>imp: SDLMAME/MAME/MAMEUIFX32 templates updated to 0.136 (SDLMAME only: new option <i>numprocessors</i>)</li>
  <li>imp: SDLMESS/MESS templates updated to 0.135 (no new or changed options)</li>
  <li>imp: added/replaced a number of embedded icons to/in the <i>classic</i> image set</li>
  <li>imp: improved the error handling of the process manager</li>
  <li>imp: build: added new make options <i>CC_FLAGS</i> and <i>CXX_FLAGS</i> to pass additional flags to the C/C++ compiler</li>
  <li>imp: reparent the detail setup dialog to the widget it was called from (main widget or settings dialog)</li>
  <li>imp: removed programmatic scrolling of front-end and emulator logs on new entries (using Qt's default now, which allows the user to scroll back and uses automatic scrolling when at the end of the log)</li>
  <li>imp: improved synchronization of log browser updates</li>
  <li>imp: minor: forcing PNG format when loading images, which offers a small performance increase</li>
  <li>imp: during a session, the item expansion state and scroll bar values of game-/machine-specific emulator configurators are preserved</li>
  <li>imp: using QStyledItemDelegate as base-class for item delegation (Qt recommendation)</li>
  <li>imp: tool tips with descriptions are now also shown for the names of emulator options (not only when hovering their editors/values)</li>
  <li>new: support for additional (<i>foreign</i>) emulators which can be used on a per-game/-machine basis</li>
  <li>new: Portuguese translation by <a href="credits.html#Marcelo">Marcelo Bossoni</a></li>
  <li>new: experimental support for Qt 4.6 (note that Qt 4.5 is still the <i>required</i> and <i>recommended</i> version)</li>
  <li>new: added new make option <i>BROWSER_PLUGINS</i> to enable/disable the use of browser plugins (default: disabled)</li>
  <li>new: X11 only: added support for optional/on-demand embedding of emulator windows through the XEmbed extension (note that without minor modifications to SDLMAME/SDLMESS, there's currently no way to distinguish between multiple instances of the same emulator, running the same game/machine) -- requires <i>xwininfo</i>!</li>
  <li>new: X11 only: optional embedder functions (snapshot tool, additional features planned)</li>
  <li>new: added new make option <i>XWININFO</i> to supply an alternate path to <i>xwininfo</i> (default: "xwininfo")</li>
  <li>new: added ability to specify a separate (i.e. fixed sized) font for all log browsers</li>
  <li>new: except for menus, <b>all</b> static icons are now scaled/adjusted to the size of the current application font (even icons on the tool bar)</li>
  <li>new: emulator configurator widgets now use check boxes (instead of combo boxes) for all boolean settings</li>
  <li>doc: updated <a href="faq.html#A1.7.1">Q1.7.1</a> and <a href="faq.html#A1.7.2">Q1.7.2</a> in FAQ to reflect Ubuntu 9.10 and openSUSE 11.2</li>

  <li>new: added new template for the original version of MESS on Windows (see data/opt/MESS/template.xml, initial version 0.130)</li>
  <li>new: added new template for MAMEUIFX32 on Windows (see data/opt/MAMEUIFX32/template.xml, initial version 0.131) -- use this template together with the MAME variant on Windows to cleanly support MAMEUIFX32 through QMC2</li>
  <li>new: added batch script for VC++ project file generation on Windows (see <i>scripts/generate-vcprojects.bat</i> -- preliminary, you'll have to adjust the path variables if you're going to use this script!)</li>

  <li>imp: automatically fall back to parent's game/machine- and emulator-info records when necessary/possible</li>
  <li>imp: build: even nicer compile output</li>
  <li>imp: more flexibility to layout the main widget (note that this can lead to unusable sub-widgets if you overdo what's possible :)</li>
  <li>imp: ROMAlyzer: colorize wrong checksums in red, unknown states in blue</li>
  <li>imp: build: added new <i>ARCADE_OPENGL</i> make option - if enabled (default), QMC2's arcade mode will support OpenGL (if available - direct rendering/hardware acceleration recommended!), otherwise only the software renderer will be available (should be fast enough, though)</li>
  <li>imp: build: added new <i>WIP</i> make option - if set to 1, unfinished code will be made available (default = 0/disabled)</li>
  <li>imp: updated redistributed Qt translations to Qt 4.4.3</li>

  <li>new: added <i>runonce</i> utility to project for use with the QMC2 variant launcher</i>
  <li>new: QMC2 variant launcher: both QMC2 variants (<i>qmc2-sdlmame</i> &amp; <i>qmc2-sdlmess</i>) can launch one another; if the <i>other</i> variant already runs, try raising it - note that this feature is <b>very</b> dependent on the window manager which may decide to ignore XMapRaised(); on KDE for example, it will only work correctly when <i>focus under mouse</i> or <i>focus <b>strictly</b> under mouse</i> has been set!)</li>
  <li>wip: arcade mode (not working in this release -- disabled by default -- use "make WIP=1 ..." for a preview)</li>
  <li>doc: added <a href="faq.html#A2.11">Q2.11</a> to FAQ</li>

<p><b>v0.2.b6, 05-JAN-2009:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>fix: startup crash on the creation of the template configuration map under certain circumstances (see tracker #2201714)</li>
  <li>fix: worked around a minor Phonon issue with duplicate metaDataChanged() signals</li>
  <li>imp: SDLMAME options template updated to 0.129 (corrected default value for <i>audio_latency</i>, revised several option descriptions, removed <i>remapjoys</i> and <i>remapjoyfile</i>, added new options <i>joy_idx1</i> - <i>joy_idx8</i>)</li>
  <li>imp: updated template format to include the template's emulator name (new format version 0.2.1)</li>
  <li>imp: ROMAlyzer: determine ROM file CRC identification troubles in ZIPs, log warnings and set the file status to <i>bad</i> in such a case (in contrast to <i>not found</i> as before)</li>
  <li>imp: code cleanup: changed several macro definitions to be consistent within QMC2's namespace</li>
  <li>imp: build: added new make options DISTCC, DISTCC_CC &amp; DISTCC_CXX (uses a distributed compiler such as <i>distcc</i> or <i>icecc</i> if DISTCC is set to 1 - check/set DISTCC_CC / DISTCC_CXX if enabled!)</li>
  <li>imp: slightly improved welcome dialog (logo, button icons and layout)</li>
  <li>imp: build: preserve existing system-wide configuration (usually /etc/qmc2/qmc2.ini) on <i>make install</i></li>
  <li>imp: build: avoid overwriting the Makefile when qmake is accidently called standalone (the project file now sets QMAKE_MAKEFILE to <i>Makefile.qmake</i>)</li>
  <li>imp: build: allow pretty compile output (doesn't work for RCC yet due to a qmake bug) - enabled per default, use make PRETTY=0 to disable</li>
  <li>imp: build: splitted CCACHECMD into CCACHE_CC &amp; CCACHE_CXX</li>
  <li>imp: build: use the same qmc2.pro project file for both debug and release builds (adding CONFIG settings dynamically on qmake call)</li>
  <li>imp: ROMAlyzer: log more CHD v3 header information (CHD tag, writable flag and parent's MD5/SHA1 checksums, if applicable)</li>
  <li>imp: ROMAlyzer: if <i>romof</i> is set in a game's XML data, but the file to merge is missing from this data (= <i>merge</i> attribute is empty), recursively search for the name of the current game's ROM file instead - MAME does exactly this in these rare cases (example: sfiiin)</li>
  <li>imp: ROMAlyzer: produce better status and log information on CHDs that were not found</li>
  <li>imp: allow higher values for <i>gamelist responsiveness</i> - setting this value higher than the total number of games will usually allow for less than 2 seconds of gamelist processing (at the expense of a more or less unresponsive GUI during reload, of course)</li>
  <li>imp: updated XML game info parser to support all current game/machine settings from MAME/MESS</li>
  <li>imp: many [Frontend] settings moved to [MAME] and [MESS] sections (automatically converted if the previous version is less than 0.2.b6)</li>
  <li>imp: code cleanup: make class and variable names emulator independent (i.e. use <i>EmulatorOptions</i> instead of <i>MameOptions</i>)</li>
  <li>new: added new SDLMESS options template (see data/opt/SDLMESS/template.xml, initial version 0.128)</li>
  <li>new: experimental support for SDLMESS (status: very basic and no <i>device</i> support yet)</li>
  <li>new: added plugin helper sample script for emulator startup interception (see scripts/plugin_helper.sh)</li>
  <li>new: all UI files regenerated with Qt 4.4's designer - Qt 4.4.0+ promoted as the new required version, although you may still be able to build it using Qt 4.3 in the short term - <b>Qt 4.3 is no longer supported!</b></li>
  <li>new: added tab icons for all main widget functions</li>
  <li>new: ROM status export tool with support for ASCII, CSV and HTML output formats - can output to file or clipboard</li>
  <li>doc: added <a href="faq.html#A2.10">Q2.10</a> to FAQ</li>

  <li>imp: exchanged Qt logo due to Qt rebranding as of 4.4.3</li>
  <li>new: support for MAME output notifications via a named pipe (SDLMAME 0.127+)</li>
  <li>new: emulator control panel changed to a multi-column tree widget displaying more information like the game name, its LEDs (if applicable), the current emulator status and additional notifiers/values not handled statically (in a sub tree)</li>
  <li>new: added a <i>copy command</i> menu item to the emulator control panel's context menu to allow for easier copying of emulator command lines to the system clipboard</li>

  <li>imp: try to use system locale to setup the language if no language was specified (or if the language is unavailable within the translations); fallback to <i>us</i> as last resort</li>
  <li>imp: joystick test and calibration widgets are enclosed in scrollable areas now to allow for better handling of high amounts of axes or buttons; due to this, the layout management for these widgets was totally revised</li>
