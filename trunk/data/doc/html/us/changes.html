<p><b>v0.38, 18-SEP-2012:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>imp: system-notes: template macro addition ($PARENT_ID$)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>v0.37, 17-SEP-2012:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>fix: changes made to multi-value floats as used in HLSL options weren't updated correctly</li>
  <li>fix: demo-mode: don't select device-sets</li>
  <li>fix: non-Windows: avoid a rare crash when exiting QMC2 while a running emulator is producing output on the notifier FIFO</li>
  <li>fix: don't allow tagging/untagging of parent-items in category- and version-views</li>
  <li>fix: file-browsers in emulator configuration dialogs used the wrong standard file-dialog so non-existing file names weren't accepted</li>
  <li>fix: ZIP-archived image files weren't correctly opened initially</li>
  <li>fix: full-screen switching on Ubuntu 12.04 (<i>Unity</i> desktop) didn't work correctly -- see <a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=26" target="_blank">bug tracker ID #26</a></li>
  <li>fix: don't pass <i>empty</i> arguments when launching foreign emulators</li>
  <li>fix: non-Windows: the optional memory indicator wasn't updated because the corresponding timer didn't fire</li>
  <li>fix: MESS device configurator: when a configuration made with the file-chooser was saved, the current slot setup wasn't stored together with it -- rendering the stored item useless when slot customizations were required</li>
  <li>fix: corrected ROM status determination for sets containing only CHDs (but no ROMs)</li>
  <li>fix: the current emulator selection made on the game/machine-specific configuration tab wasn't saved upon reload</li>
  <li>fix: minor: corrected progress-text updates when certain operations are running 'in parallel' (i.e. loading the software-list while a full ROM audit is active)</li>
  <li>fix: avoid crash when no game/machine is selected and a 'play' action is triggered</li>
  <li>fix: MiniWebBrowser: corrected document history handling with regard to the availability of back- and forward-actions</li>
  <li>fix: set locale- and c-string-encoding to UTF-8 globally and handle XML data specifically on Windows to cleanly support international character sets</li>
  <li>fix: emulator wasn't launched under certain circumstances when the game/machine was filtered out due to its ROM status</li>
  <li>fix: use UTF-8 character encoding when reading game-/machine- and/or emulator-info DB dat-sources</li>
  <li>imp: adjusted the ghost-image used for videos (wrong text removed)</li>
  <li>imp: depending on the installed codecs, an unused YouTube widget may still cause load on the system, so it's now already destroyed when it's no longer required</li>
  <li>imp: updated redistributed Qt translations from Qt 4.8.3</li>
  <li>imp: unified the image processing to remove code duplication for different image types</li>
  <li>imp: check for the existence of the emulator's executable file before trying to actually run a null process (which may cause issues on Mac OS X)</li>
  <li>imp: Mac OS X build: added build option <i>XCODE3</i> which (if set to 1) will disable the special handling when Qt 4.8+ is detected</li>
  <li>imp: MAME/MESS/UME emulator templates updated to 0.147 (added new core options <i>ui_mouse</i> and <i>ui_active</i>, removed option <i>hide_cursor</i>)</li>
  <li>imp: added an option to allow for setting QMC2's working directory to be the same as the executable's path (for <u>special</u> use cases, not commonly used)</li>
  <li>imp: replaced all QMC2 variant logos and splash-screens with improved versions from JacKc</li>
  <li>imp: Qt messages that are sent before the GUI is ready are now printed to the console (stdout) instead of eating them</li>
  <li>imp: emulator configuration widgets: all drop-down lists for 'bios' / 'ramsize' selections or options with pre-defined choices are now sorted, possible duplicates are removed and the number of visible items has been increased to 20</li>
  <li>imp: the file-chooser's folder selector is now also sorted / sortable</li>
  <li>imp: foreign emulator IDs can now contain arguments with white-space characters when they are enclosed in double-quotes</li>
  <li>imp: changed the file-chooser's sorting (by file name) to be case-insensitive</li>
  <li>imp: updated template format to v0.2.6 which adds support to ignore complete sections (globally or per target OS)</li>
  <li>imp: Mac OS X build: don't compile <i>runonce</i> as it's not used on Mac OS X (and has an X11 requirement)</li>
  <li>imp: integrated zlib updated to version 1.2.7 (see <a href="http://zlib.net/ChangeLog.txt" target="_blank">zlib's change-log</a> for details)</li>
  <li>imp: Win32 MinGW build: added OS auto-detection for Windows so specification of MINGW=1 is no longer required (however, if MINGW is set, its value will be used regardless)</li>
  <li>imp: when a non-default (= foreign) emulator is selected for the current game/machine, the device-mapper and software-list tabs are disabled now</li>
  <li>imp: sets with <i>empty</i> names are now ignored, logging corresponding warnings when the game/machine list cache is recreated (this is a driver bug which also '-validate' will warn about)</li>
  <li>imp: Win32 VC++ build: added x64 support to the project generation script</li>
  <li>imp: added an advanced line-edit containing an icon to symbolize its function (used in certain search widgets)</li>
  <li>imp: changed the default short-cuts for adding games/machines to the favorites list (now Ctrl+J and Ctrl+Shift+J) to free the Ctrl+F short-cut for another/better use (i.e. for finding arbitrary text)</li>
  <li>imp: changed the default short-cut for 'About QMC2' (now Ctrl+B) to free the Ctrl+A short-cut which is commonly used for 'select all'</li>
  <li>imp: file-chooser: opened ZIP contents are sorted as well</li>
  <li>imp: completely revised the image cache internals, now also storing the file path the cached image was loaded from, which can be retrieved via the image's context-menu (the file path is not available in case of zipped images, though)</li>
  <li>imp: much better GUI response while recreating the XML cache and checking all ROMs (full audit)</li>
  <li>imp: animate searching for game/machine XML data when the user expands an item in the primary (full-detail) view</li>
  <li>imp: the menu-bar on Mac OS X is no longer 'native' because this misbehaves with <i>multiple</i> menu-bars that we have now</li>
  <li>imp: emulator configuration widgets are now initially hidden and shown after all options were loaded, which speeds up this process a little bit (you won't see a <i>visual</i> difference, though)</li>
  <li>imp: added OS detection for Windows 8 and Mac OS X 10.8 to the about dialog when Qt 4.8.3 or higher is used</li>
  <li>new: added support for <a href="http://mamedev.emulab.it/haze/" target="_blank">David Haywood's (Haze)</a> <i>Universal Machine Emulator</i> (MAME/MESS unification project) in the form of an additional variant called 'qmc2-ume' or 'qmc2-sdlume' -- see <a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=22" target="_blank">bug tracker ID #22</a></li>
  <li>new: the YouTube video-player now supports local movie files as well</li>
  <li>new: added support for tool-bar customization</li>
  <li>new: allow the specification of semicolon-separated lists of folders for ALL image types</li>
  <li>new: added support for system- and manufacturer-logo images (i. e. <a href="http://www.progettosnaps.net/mess/" target="_blank">AntoPISA's new <i>MESS marquees</i></a>)</li>
  <li>new: added support for the new MESS category.ini from <a href="http://forums.bannister.org/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showprofile&User=5387" target="_blank">ASH</a> (UME targets merge the info with data from catver.ini, if applicable)</li>
  <li>new: added a check for the ROM path setting (a warning message will pop up when the ROM path hasn't been set or isn't available) -- see <a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=28" target="_blank">bug tracker ID #28</a></li>
  <li>new: made a complete rewrite of the image-checker dialog, which now allows checks of ALL image types in a multi-threaded way -- this also fixes a long-standing bug on Windows, BTW (see <a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=5" target="_blank">bug tracker ID #5</a>)</li>
  <li>new: MESS device configurator: added support for <i>nested</i> slots, including real slot recursion</li>
  <li>new: software-lists: available mount-devices are dynamically updated whenever the device/slot setup changes</li>
  <li>new: added 3 new actions to tag / untag / invert tags of all <i>visible</i> sets (according to the current ROM state filter)</li>
  <li>new: game/machine detail tabs can now also be reordered directly in the GUI by dragging them with the mouse</li>
  <li>new: added a tool action to open a new empty browser window on demand</li>
  <li>new: &lt;info&gt; elements contained in a number of software-list entries are now displayed as well (requires very recent MAME/MESS/UME versions after 0.146u5, otherwise &lt;info&gt; elements are not contained in the -listsoftware output)</li>
  <li>new: items in all game/machine list views can now be tagged/untagged while the 'cursor' is moved, using the new (customizable) short-cuts Shift+Up and Shift+Down (works much like in 'Total Commander' when tagging/untagging files or folders)</li>
  <li>new: the file-chooser now offers an additional context-menu item to open regular files (<b>not</b> ZIP content yet!) externally by launching the default application that's associated with the file's MIME type (or extension)</li>
  <li>new: added a 'personal rich-text notes' detail for games/machines (same as the software-notes feature, but for systems this time)</li>
  <li>new: added command line option '-cc' which clears (removes) all emulator caches prior to starting up</li>
  <li>new: HTML editor: added document preview in built-in browser as well as 'new-from-template' and 'revert-from-saved-file' functionality</li>
  <li>new: MESS device configurator: added support for selecting the BIOS used in slot-devices (if applicable)</li>
  <li>new: software-lists: optional automatic adjustment of the emulator's <i>-snapname</i> parameter for easier creation of software-snapshots</li>
  <li>doc: use a common image directory instead of sym-links</li>
  <li>inf: the configuration template for MAMEUIFX32 has been dropped (unmaintained)</li>
  <li>inf: long project name changed to <i>M.A.M.E./M.E.S.S./U.M.E. Catalog / Launcher II</i></li>
</ul>
<p><b>v0.36, 21-MAY-2012:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>fix: ROMAlyzer: don't stop searching for CHDs at the first ROM path (when there are multiple ROM paths)</li>
  <li>fix: allow embedding of (MAME/MESS-like) foreign emulators again -- changes made in 0.35 prevented this completely</li>
  <li>fix: changed the default short-cut for the <i>check template map</i> action to 'Ctrl+Shift+C' -- the previous default of 'Ctrl+C' was awkward since it's usually used as short-cut for <i>copy to clipboard</i></li>
  <li>fix: avoid crashes in the game list parser and the ROMAlyzer's checksum wizard due to unexpected nameless entries (first appeared in MESS 0.145u1+)</li>
  <li>fix: build: corrected a new set of compile-time bugs related to builds with PHONON=0</li>
  <li>fix: ROMAlyzer: after updating CHDs to the latest format, update the CHD header information from the replaced file before comparing the SHA1 checksums</li>
  <li>fix: minor: corrected a few texts with regard to the current variant's emulator type (MAME vs. MESS)</li>
  <li>fix: file-chooser: expand/collapse ZIP-contents on any type of 'activation' (i.e. not only on mouse double-clicks but also when enter or return are pressed, includes navigation via cursor-keys)</li>
  <li>fix: re-enable 'locked' widgets when the emulator can't be started for reading the game/machine data</li>
  <li>fix: MESS device configurator: corrected display of file-editor's data when there's only one available device instance (by synchronizing delegate/model updates)</li>
  <li>fix: don't start a verification process when the ROM state cache can't be opened for writing</li>
  <li>fix: file-chooser: the machine-dependent software-folder was not correctly pre-selected when existing device configurations were loaded in parallel</li>
  <li>fix: MESS device configurator: avoid a rare crash when systems are hovered very quickly (asynchronous updates may otherwise work on meanwhile invalid data)</li>
  <li>fix: clear favorites and play-history upon reload and make sure the last selected game/machine is correctly re-selected (if applicable)</li>
  <li>fix: ROMAlyzer: when repairing a set and the wanted CRC or name (header-)entry already exists in the target ZIP, recreate the complete ZIP file in order to replace the 'bad' file</li>
  <li>fix: ROMAlyzer: don't rewrite sets that are analyzed on behalf of the checksum-wizard (even if 'rewrite while analyzing' has been activated)</li>
  <li>fix: corrected some additional MESS-specific phrases and removed WIP-only stuff from key- &amp; joystick-mappers</li>
  <li>fix: adjusted the behavior of the two main search combo-boxes and tied them more closely</li>
  <li>fix: software-lists: support <u>multiple</u> allowed device-interface types</li>
  <li>fix: MiniWebBrowser: don't raise main-widget / lower browser window(s) when selecting the path to save a downloadable resource</li>
  <li>fix: corrected character conversion when compressing HTML data stored in in-memory and on-disk web-caches (using QString::toLocal8Bit() instead of QString::toLatin1() now)</li>
  <li>imp: ROMAlyzer: LRU-caching XML data positions in order to speed up merge-processing</li>
  <li>imp: updated the MAME variant's logo with an improved version from JacKc</li>
  <li>imp: MESS device configurator: log a warning when '-listslots' crashes</li>
  <li>imp: MAME/MESS emulator templates updated to 0.146 (fixed duplication of option 'natural' in MESS templates)</li>
  <li>imp: interpret the new 'has no roms' status as 'good' (a.k.a. correct)</li>
  <li>imp: foreign emulator support: added $DESCRIPTION$ as an optional argument placeholder for the set's description</li>
  <li>imp: ROMAlyzer: interpret emu- and file-states of sets that have no ROMs as 'good' also in case of MAME (new since 0.145u2)</li>
  <li>imp: ROM status check: circumvent the corner case of sets without ROMs also in case of MAME (new since 0.145u2, see 'ide_baseboard' and 'hdd' devices)</li>
  <li>imp: ROMAlyzer: log possible driver XML bugs where a merge-name is given without a parent set to take it from (other than this, these cases are ignored and treated as 'good' merge-states)</li>
  <li>imp: when registering foreign emulators, the existence of the <i>$ID$</i> placeholder on the supplied command line is now indicated through a green/yellow colored label (when $ID$ is missing, the configuration will most likely not work)</li>
  <li>imp: allow the specification of the emulator's working directory already in the welcome dialog</li>
  <li>imp: updated redistributed Qt translations from Qt 4.8.1</li>
  <li>imp: honor 'players' value for device sets where applicable (i.e. some input devices)</li>
  <li>imp: MESS device configurator: sort slot-options alphanumerically, add a separator between 'not used' and available options, allow disabling of <i>default</i> slot-options and indicate them as such</li>
  <li>imp: main widget: revised all auto-connected menu actions to use QAction::triggered(bool) (instead of a meanwhile deprecated signal)</li>
  <li>imp: slightly better responsiveness while loading cached XML data</li>
  <li>imp: Mac OS X build: avoid using xcodebuild for Qt 4.8+</li>
  <li>imp: replaced the 'MESS wiki driver look-up' with a ProjectMESS-based search since most data in the MESS wiki was lost, and ProjectMESS is the new de-facto '#1 web-resource for all things MESS' :)</li>
  <li>imp: the MiniWebBrowser's zoom-factor can now also be specified through a (mouse) wheel-event when the Ctrl-key is pressed at the same time (like most standalone browsers)</li>
  <li>new: ROMAlyzer: added support for CHD v5 (new since MAME/MESS 0.145u1) -- built-in analysis will work for CHD v3, v4 and v5; however, note that all 'CHD manager' functionality <b>requires chdman from MAME/MESS 0.145u1+ now</b></li>
  <li>new: ROMAlyzer: added a function to store the current log contents to a file</li>
  <li>new: added tear-off capability to all menus within menu-bars</li>
  <li>new: added freely customizable lists of game/machine IDs (and descriptions) that can be attached to foreign emulators and be presented / launched through the menu</li>
  <li>new: both the MAWS (off-line) and the ProjectMESS driver look-up features save/restore their zoom-factors now</li>
  <li>new: experimental support for Qt 5, which is in alpha-stage right now (there will be no embedder support on X11 platforms in the first place, since they dropped some X11-specific classes like the QX11EmbedContainer -- an add-on for Qt 5 to revive this functionality is planned, but will probably not be available before Qt 5.1)</li>
  <li>new: YouTube video-player: you can now also 'paste' a YouTube video URL into the video-player itself, which will then start playing the respective video without attaching it to the play list</li>
  <li>new: about dialog: added output of run-time Qt library paths to the system-information page</li>
  <li>new: integrated zlib 1.2.6 to remove the extra requirement</li>
  <li>new: the MiniWebBrowser now supports and allows pop-up window requests when the build option BROWSER_JAVASCRIPT is enabled (which is the default)</li>
  <li>new: build option BROWSER_EXTRAS is now enabled by default which also activates the use of QtWebKit's <i>Web Inspector</i> in the MiniWebBrowser for everyone</li>
  <li>new: added a Spanish translation -- thanks to <a href="credits.html#Daniel">Daniel Barrado</a></li>
  <li>wip: adding a set rename tool to the ROMAlyzer which uses the -listxml outputs from both the old and the current emulator to gather the changes automagically</li>
  <li>wip: adding a Romanian translation (mostly done) -- thanks to <a href="credits.html#Mihai">Mihai Boisteanu</a></li>
  <li>wip: adding an Italian translation -- thanks to <a href="credits.html#Stefano">Stefano Cereda</a></li>
  <li>wip: adding a stand-alone CHDMAN GUI (see tools/qchdman/)</li>
  <li>wip: adding a Greek translation -- thanks to <a href="credits.html#Kostas">Kostas Albanidis</a></li>
  <li>wip: adding a Swedish translation -- thanks to <a href="credits.html#DanielNylander">Daniel Nylander</a></li>
</ul>
<p><b>v0.35, 06-FEB-2012:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>fix: minor: hide the software-list favorites column 'device configuration' for MAME targets as it's a MESS-only feature</li>
  <li>fix: minor: corrected the main progress-bar's visual behavior when ROM status checking and software-list caching are running in parallel</li>
  <li>fix: MAME targets: the software-list widget wasn't cleared upon reload</li>
  <li>fix: the last active detail-tab's header wasn't always shown initially</li>
  <li>fix: software-snapshots were positioned incorrectly under certain circumstances</li>
  <li>fix: corrected a few minor log-scrolling issues</li>
  <li>fix: individual ROM checks didn't work correctly when the ROM status was 'not found' since output is written to stderr in this case and not to stdout as otherwise</li>
  <li>fix: YouTube video-player: avoid crashes on exit by waiting for all application threads to finish before returning to the OS</li>
  <li>fix: YouTube video-player: attached videos could get lost when changing the current game/machine very quickly</li>
  <li>fix: ROMAlyzer: correctly 'remove' the progress-bar item-widget before deleting it (worked w/o until Qt 4.7.x, crashed since Qt 4.8.0)</li>
  <li>fix: corrected restoration of main-widget's layout when the front-end was showing a maximized embedded emulator during clean up on the previous run</li>
  <li>fix: corrected Windows 64-bit builds with DEBUG=2 (see <a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=21" target="_blank">bug tracker ID #21</a>)</li>
  <li>fix: file-chooser: the underlying item model now produces correct minimum widths for icon-less columns (size and modification date)</li>
  <li>fix: embedder on X11: corrected initial input focus after launching a new embedded emulator</li>
  <li>imp: ROM status exporter: additional output-format choice ('all formats') to export the ROM states to all three formats at once</li>
  <li>imp: when a software-list can't be found (though it's expected to exist), leave the software-list widget disabled and don't try to parse the invalid XML (a warning will still be logged since this is actually an emulator bug, but probably also a wanted/known situation as told by <a href="http://forums.bannister.org/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showprofile&User=1564" target="_blank">etabeta78</a>)</li>
  <li>imp: MAME/MESS emulator templates updated to 0.145</li>
  <li>imp: faster display of software-snapshots by using tool-tip like window attributes for the viewer widget (this also fixes bad-window errors on X11)</li>
  <li>imp: slightly bigger icons in all game/machine list views</li>
  <li>imp: updated template format to v0.2.5 which adds support for an optional 'part' attribute that can be used in file-type options to specify the extracted part of the file's path (currently only "basename" is supported, used by the effect-option)</li>
  <li>imp: loading of software-lists can be interrupted now and is indicated accordingly for larger lists (i.e. cpc_cass/cpc_flop)</li>
  <li>imp: Mac OS X build: moved macx/Info.plist.in to arch/Darwin/Info.plist.in where it belongs</li>
  <li>imp: build: added a 'configure' make target to create platform dependent project file(s) and stop (i.e. to open it in XCode and build from there on Mac OS X, or to run MinGW make in job-server mode on Windows)</li>
  <li>imp: MiniWebBrowser: browser-plugins are now enabled per default (see make option <i>BROWSER_PLUGINS</i>)</li>
  <li>imp: build: removed make option <i>PRETTY</i> as it's no longer usable in the supported Qt versions</li>
  <li>imp: Mac OS X build: provide application icons (.icns) to be associated with the apps</li>
  <li>imp: created new logo images (thanks to JacKc)</li>
  <li>imp: ROMAlyzer: checksum-wizard: when the user changes the checksum-type and the current checksum is available in the 'other' type as well, display it in the line-edit (not available when the checksum is edited manually)</li>
  <li>new: the ROM state filtering mechanism can now be enabled/disabled on-the-fly (the default is 'enabled', just as before)</li>
  <li>new: added support for multi-device software-list entries as well as automatic vs. manual mount-device selection (includes the ability to mix parts from different software-list entries)</li>
  <li>new: added an alternative game/machine search entry box to the tool-bar</li>
  <li>new: added a CSV and ASCII export tool for software-lists</li>
  <li>new: added import/export functionality for software-list <i>favorites</i></li>
  <li>new: changed the MESS device configurator so it offers available device-instances based on the slot-options specified, thus allowing to <i>mount</i> them as well (through the legacy device-mapper and the file-chooser)</li>
  <li>new: added ZIP support for software-snapshots</li>
  <li>new: X11 and Windows only: game/machine icons are now also shown on the tab headers of embedded emulators</li>
  <li>new: all images have an additional context-menu item ('refresh') now to clear and reload their cached pendants</li>
  <li>new: integrated the HTML editor from <a href="http://qt.gitorious.org/qt-labs/graphics-dojo" target="_blank">Qt Labs / graphics-dojo</a> for all kinds of (upcoming) rich-text editing purposes</li>
  <li>new: added content-zoom to the MiniWebBrowser</li>
  <li>new: top-level windows can now optionally be minimized upon emulation launch and automatically restored when the (last) emulator instance has ended</li>
  <li>new: YouTube video-player: added a semi-transparent overlay widget to display status information at the bottom of the player's viewport</li>
  <li>new: software-lists: added software-compatibility filtering</li>
  <li>new: added a 'MESS wiki' detail to look up available driver information</li>
  <li>new: added an option to suppress all messages sent through QDebug and related convenience functions</li>
  <li>new: added an optional startup splash-screen utilizing the new logos</li>
  <li>new: added support for emulator-embedding on Windows (!) -- note, however, that embedding of emulators running in <i>Direct 3D</i> mode ('-video d3d') has two known issues: full-screen switching will lead to a crash (of the emulator) and screen-shots aren't taken correctly from within the GUI (just a black image)</li>
  <li>new: X11 and Windows only: added an option to select the <i>default launch-mode</i> used when starting emulation by <i>activating</i> (i.e. double-clicking) an entry in any list</li>
  <li>new: X11 and Windows only: replaced the style-controlled embedder-release icons (usually a red 'X' which some users wrongly interpreted as 'exit emulator') with a more suitable / less irritating and style-independent icon by setting explicit style-sheets on the tab-bars of all embedders</li>
  <li>new: added two options to allow for hiding of BIOS and/or device sets in all master-lists (see <i>Front end</i> -&gt; <i>Game/Machine list</i> in the main setup dialog) -- both will trigger an automatic reload when changed</li>
  <li>new: added a dock-able/floating software-detail widget with a separate snapshot-browser, a <a href="http://www.progettoemma.net/mess/" target="_blank">ProjectMESS</a> software-lookup feature, and an HTML editor/viewer for personal rich-text software-notes</li>
  <li>inf: <b>the new required minimum Qt version is 4.7.0</b>, support for older versions of Qt has been dropped</li>
</ul>
<p><b>v0.34, 15-NOV-2011:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>fix: MAME targets: don't auto-resize the last column in the game/machine list views when toggling the use of catver.ini (it annoys more than it helps)</li>
  <li>fix: build: corrected compile-time bugs related to builds with PHONON=0</li>
  <li>fix: adjust icon sizes when showing the audio-effect dialog initially</li>
  <li>fix: removed flicker on changing game-/machine-list views</li>
  <li>fix: corrected a few MESS-specific phrases</li>
  <li>fix: corrected delegate-sizing issues when there's only one device instance in the MESS device setup</li>
  <li>fix: Mac OS X: set ROMAlyzer's parent widget in order to avoid context-menu displacement</li>
  <li>fix: ROMAlyzer: the ROM set's context-menu should be available also when the set rewriter hasn't been enabled</li>
  <li>fix: MAME targets: category- and version-views were not created initially when switched to via the view-selector combo-box</li>
  <li>fix: MAME targets: demo-mode: avoid floating-point exception when no games were selected by the filter</li>
  <li>imp: updated minizip to version 1.01h</li>
  <li>imp: YouTube video player: decode (percent-)encoded error messages before logging them</li>

  <li>imp: MAME/MESS emulator templates updated to 0.144</li>
  <li>imp: ROMAlyzer: better 'no dump' indication</li>
  <li>imp: enabled audio-effect widgets for MinGW builds (they work fine when the <b>official</b> Qt DLLs are being used, otherwise set the new <i>AUDIOEFFECTDIALOGS</i> make option to 0 in order to disable them)</li>
  <li>imp: X11 only: minor embedder optimizations regarding widget resizing</li>
  <li>imp: YouTube video player: added support for YouTube's new way of presenting video stream URLs</li>
  <li>imp: general overhaul of the main-widget's layout parameters to allow for a somewhat more 'compact' design</li>
  <li>imp: the working directory of the external ROM tool can be specified now</li>
  <li>imp: build: added <i>EMU</i> as an alias for the <i>EMULATOR</i> make option</li>
  <li>imp: locale-aware statistics in the ROM status exporter and the GUI's ROM status bar</li>
  <li>imp: updated redistributed Qt translations from Qt 4.7.4</li>
  <li>new: added a 'driver status' column to all game/machine lists (or views)</li>
  <li>new: Windows only: the <i>other</i> variant's exe file can now be specified explicitly (the default is to search for it only in the directory where the calling variant was started from) -- this works also when you rename the exe files; you can additionally specify the command line arguments passed to the <i>other</i> variant (note that this is an independent setting and would also be used when the variant exe is not overwritten!)</li>
  <li>new: support for MAME's/MESS's new device-referencing (new since 0.143u2+ SVN)</li>
  <li>new: Mac OS X only: the tool-bar can now optionally be unified with the title-bar</li>
  <li>new: MESS targets: support for machine-specific device slots / slot options, integrated with the MESS device configurator</li>
  <li>new: the MESS variants now use their own logo, and all variants use new unified applications icons -- thanks to <a href="http://forums.bannister.org/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showprofile&User=3340" target="_blank">Anna Wu</a></li>
  <li>new: added a new tool-function to allow for forced removal of ALL emulator related caches at once</li>
  <li>new: added support for the new 'messinfo.dat' file from AntoPISA (see <a href="http://www.progettosnaps.net/messinfo/" target="_blank">http://www.progettosnaps.net/messinfo/</a>)</li>
  <li>new: completed the support for software-lists in MAME and MESS (ZIP-support for software-snaps will be added later)</li>
  <li>new: customizable columns in all game-/machine-list and software-list views</li>
  <li>new: MESS targets: a new 'file chooser' dialog has been added to the MESS device configurator as an easy-to-use alternative to the manual setup</li>
  <li>new: MESS targets: device type icons are now displayed to better symbolize MESS device instances</li>
  <li>new: ROMAlyzer: you can specify an additional source ROM path for the set rewriter in order to allow for merging updates</li>
  <li>new: added support for <i>item-tagging</i> and a number of related operations that can now also be performed for tagged games/machines</li>
  <li>new: for ZIP-archived icons (actually the only practical way to store them) support for ICO format has been added -- this means that for instance <a href="http://icons.mameworld.info/" target="_blank">MAMU's icon</a> can now be used directly, w/o conversion to PNGs!</li>
  <li>new: icons are now also supported for all MESS targets</li>
  <li>wip: adding a Java (Eclipse/SWT) based editor/translator for emulator templates (see <i>tools/qmc2_options_editor_java</i>) -- thanks to <a href="credits.html#Marcelo">Marcelo Bossoni</a></li>
  <li>inf: note that <b>the versioning pattern has changed</b>: we now just count the releases and follow the simple scheme '0.XX', where XX is the release number</li>
  <li>inf: note that <b>the minimum required MESS revision now is SVN r12599</b> (or MESS 0.143u3)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>v0.2.b20, 29-JUN-2011:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>fix: ROMAlyzer / checksum wizard: correctly handle ROM files when their names contain special characters (i.e. '&amp;')</li>
  <li>fix: corrected the handling of repeated log messages (the repetition counter was correctly logged, but the actual <i>new</i> message was eaten)</li>
  <li>fix: remove Phonon effects asynchronously (aka QObject::deleteLater()) -- note that this finally also fixes the long-standing post-mortem crash on Mac OS X</li>
  <li>fix: file and directory edit widgets did only commit any data changes when they were 'edited', but not when their data changed 'spontaneously' -- see <a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=17" target="_blank">bug tracker ID #17</a></li>
  <li>fix: MESS targets: avoid crash when exiting while a device setup is open</li>
  <li>fix: emulator configuration: correctly position the text cursor for 'int' and 'float' option types as well</li>
  <li>fix: corrected hiding of category-/version-columns in the category-/version-views</li>
  <li>fix: embedder: under certain window-managers (i.e. KDE4 &gt;= 4.6) the snapshot-viewer wasn't correctly updated -- fixed by adding an explicit paintEvent() method which just repaints the background brush</li> 
  <li>fix: Win32: emulator control panel: hide LED0-, LED1- and status-columns, because notifiers aren't supported on Windows (yet)</li>
  <li>fix: build: corrected the default image directory settings used for /etc/qmc2/qmc2.ini during installation (see <i>inst/qmc2.ini.template</i>)</li>
  <li>fix: minor: put arguments containing white-space characters in double-quotes when presenting/copying the emulator command line</li>
  <li>fix: log file paths weren't correctly set up on the initial run, so logs were written only on subsequent runs</li>
  <li>fix: corrected a rather old bug within the game/machine-list cache creation code that could've led to rare (and hard to reproduce) crashes</li>
  <li>fix: ROM status exporter: CSV and HTML output formats didn't honor the specified ROM status filter</li>
  <li>fix: ROMAlyzer: corrected (minor) overflow issues caused by using plural-translation with large unsigned numbers (Qt only supports this cleanly for signed integers)</li>
  <li>imp: SDLMAME/MAME/MAMEUIFX32 templates updated to 0.143 (new option <i>menu</i> for MAME, removed option <i>uimodekey</i> for MAME, changed default value of <i>audio_latency</i> for SDLMAME, added new options <i>use_cpanels</i>, <i>use_marquees</i> and <i>confirm_quit</i> for all, added many new HLSL options for MAME)</li>
  <li>imp: SDLMESS/MESS templates updated to 0.143 (changed default value of <i>audio_latency</i> for SDLMESS, added new options <i>use_cpanels</i>, <i>use_marquees</i> and <i>confirm_quit</i> for all, added many new HLSL options for MESS)</li>
  <li>imp: ghost image enhanced, including a derived 'no video' pendant</li>
  <li>imp: improved log output when the validation of the emulator executable fails</li>
  <li>imp: MESS targets: added new / alternate emulator type identification string ('M.E.S.S.' vs. 'MESS') as used since 0.142 SVN -- see <a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=16" target="_blank">bug tracker ID #16</a></li>
  <li>imp: MESS targets: the device configurator now also saves / restores the last selected setup (if any) and includes a context menu for the device instance map</li>
  <li>imp: added an option to let the user decide if the ROM status icons are to be shown or not (see in game/machine-list tab of the main setup dialog)</li>
  <li>imp: avoid potential blocking when synchronously calling external programs</li>
  <li>imp: updated template format to v0.2.4 which adds support for a new 'combo' option-type (editable combo-box with pre-defined choices the user can select from), a new 'visible' attribute to hide certain options (esp. to hide the <i>ramsize</i> option for MAME, where it's not used, but the emulator still reports it as a valid option), two additional option types ('float2', 'float3') for multi-part floating point values and an optional <i>decimals</i> attribute for all float types to specify the precision (default precision: '6 decimals')</li>
  <li>imp: setup dialog: added the ability to reset a customized application- or log-font as well as to reset the style-sheet (note that the system's default font will be gathered during startup, so if its value changes at run-time you will have to restart QMC2 for correct behavior)</li>
  <li>imp: reduced (eliminated?) flickering upon creation of game-/machine-specific emulator configuration widgets</li>
  <li>imp: the game/machine search function now also searches through the 'short names' (or game/machine IDs), so for instance entering 'snes' would also return valid results for MESS</li>
  <li>imp: variant launching now also works on Windows (it's assumed that the 'other' variant exe can be found in the same path as the currently running one)</li>
  <li>imp: MESS targets: device configurator: modified the extension filter to be case-insensitive when browsing for device files, added a 'clear' button to reset a device instance mapping and added a 'remove configuration' action to the context-menu for available device configurations</li>
  <li>imp: ROMAlyzer: honor the system locale when logging CHD header information (logical size and other numbers)</li>
  <li>new: added command line option <i>-qmc2_config_path</i> to allow for overwriting the path where QMC2 stores its setup, caches etc. -- it's in the user's responsibility to copy/move the data to the desired directory (otherwise QMC2 will start over, which may be wanted behavior, though)</li>
  <li>new: support for game/machine <i>attached</i> YouTube videos (Phonon-based video player)</li>
  <li>new: added 4 new tool-functions to allow for forced removal of any game-/machine- and software-list related cache data stored on disk</li>
  <li>new: added support to provide lists of available BIOS sets (MAME &amp; MESS) and RAM size options (MESS-only) in the game/machine-specific emulator configuration widgets</li>
  <li>new: MESS targets: added a 'general software folder' setting used as the default directory for the MESS device configurator (when no individual software folder was specified explicitly); when a sub-folder named as the currently selected machine exists in this directory, that folder will be selected automatically</li>
  <li>new: MESS targets: enabled the use of a 'cabinet detail' for MESS as well</li>
  <li>new: added support for the MinGW (GCC) compiler on Windows (you need the <a href="http://mamedev.org/tools" target="_blank">MAME dev-tools</a> plus the <a href="http://qmc2.arcadehits.net/wordpress/download/#contribs_qmc2_mame_dev_addon" target="_blank">QMC2 add-on package</a> for your architecture)</li>
  <li>wip: completing the support for software lists -- basically working, but some planned functionality is still missing, and there are open questions regarding the official way to scan the hash XML data</li>
  <li>doc: added <a href="faq.html#A2.14">Q2.14</a>, <a href="faq.html#A2.15">Q2.15</a>, <a href="faq.html#A2.16">Q2.16</a> and <a href="faq.html#A2.17">Q2.17</a> to the FAQ</li>
</ul>
<p><b>v0.2.b19, 03-APR-2011:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>fix: ROMAlyzer: corrected status determination for ROM files that have no dump (but for which the file size or any checksums are available through the XML data)</li>
  <li>fix: corrected the scrolling behavior of the front-end and emulator logs</li>
  <li>fix: MESS targets only: corrected ROM status determination for machines that require no ROMs</li>
  <li>fix: correctly display document titles / title changes in the mini web browser</li>
  <li>fix: MP3 player: corrected auto-repeating of pressed (and held) fast-forward / fast-backward buttons</li>
  <li>fix: corrected MAWS web-cache compression (works also on Windows now)</li>
  <li>fix: embedder: avoid left-over embed container widget when an emulator dies unexpectedly while it's currently being embedded</li>
  <li>fix: demo mode: avoid saving game configurations while in demo mode (may crash)</li>
  <li>fix: corrected the conversion to/from some (HTML encoded) special characters as used in a few game/machine descriptions and manufacturer names</li>
  <li>fix: ensure correct parsing of XML attributes when retrieving game/machine details</li>
  <li>fix: mini web browser: don't produce lower case URL patterns when validating entered strings</li>
  <li>fix: corrected ROM cache updates on individual ROM status checks</li>
  <li>imp: ROMAlyzer: improved performance for CRC identification of ZIP-archived ROM files</li>
  <li>imp: ROMAlyzer: generally improved progress indication</li>
  <li>imp: all logs are now based on read-only QPlainTextEdit's as this class is much better optimized for large amounts of plain-text data (compared to rich-text capabable QTextBrowser's, which were used before)</li>
  <li>imp: SDLMESS/MESS templates updated to 0.141 (new option <i>uifont</i>, changed default value of <i>writeconfig</i>)</li>
  <li>imp: SDLMAME/MAME/MAMEUIFX32 templates updated to 0.142 (new option <i>ramsize</i> for all, new options <i>syncrefresh</i>, <i>bench</i> and <i>watchdog</i> for SDLMAME, removed option <i>uimodekey</i> for SDLMAME)</li>
  <li>imp: MESS targets only: for machines that require no ROMs, the ROMAlyzer will now display both their emulation- and file-states as 'good' (as opposed to 'unknown' / 'not found' which was used before)</li>
  <li>imp: launching of BIOS sets will no longer be prevented (it actually makes sense for some of them) -- except in demo mode, where BIOS sets are never selected</li>
  <li>imp: Windows build: revised the VC++ project generation script to be fully automatic and to also support VC++ 2010 (requires <a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/sed.htm" target="_blank">sed for Windows</a> now!)</a>
  <li>imp: support for additional XML data in game/machine details (<i>tag</i> and <i>mask</i> as sub-elements of <i>configuration</i>)</li>
  <li>imp: embedder: when embedder maximization is turned on, the menu-, status- and tool-bars as well as the game-/machine-list status frame are now automatically hidden while an emulator is shown</li>
  <li>imp: embedder: the embedder maximization toggle button now uses two icons to indicate the action taken when it's clicked</li>
  <li>imp: updated redistributed Qt translations from Qt 4.7.2</li>
  <li>new: ROMAlyzer: added a <i>checksum wizard</i> to search for SHA1 or CRC hashes in all sets, to qualify the states of the results and to repair <i>bad</i> sets from <i>good</i> ones (note: the set repair function works only for ZIPs at the moment -- create backups before using it!)</li>
  <li>new: ROMAlyzer: if a ROM or CHD file that's expected to be merged from a parent set is loaded from the child set instead, a warning is logged (may be obsolete); the report will contain green (OK), yellow (warning) or red (critical) symbols to indicate the merge status</li>
  <li>new: ROMAlyzer: added a <i>set rewriter</i> function to programmatically rewrite (clean) ROM sets on demand and/or while analysing them (works only for ZIPs!)</li>
  <li>new: ROMAlyzer: the number of reported sets held in memory can now be limited (which is important for long batch runs where the memory consumption can otherwise grow enormously); the new default behavior now is that after 1000 analyzed sets the ROMAlyzer will start to remove the oldest reports</li>
  <li>new: you can now select the position chosen by QMC2 when scrolling to the current game/machine item (the setting actually applies to <b>all</b> views &amp; lists); the default is <i>top</i> (= old behavior)</li>
  <li>new: all game/machine detail images now have a context menu with a 'copy to clipboard' item</li>
  <li>new: added new compile-time setting <i>BROWSER_PREFETCH_DNS</i> to allow for prefetching of DNS lookups by the mini web browser (Qt 4.6 and higher)</li>
  <li>new: embedder: embedded emulators can now automatically be paused when they are hidden and resumed when they are shown (requires the MAME/MESS notifier FIFO in order to correctly track any state changes)</li>
  <li>new: embedder: the current status of an embedded emulator is now indicated through traffic lights in the respective tab widget header</li>
  <li>new: added support for a 'number of players' column to the game/machine list as suggested by Francisco Javier Felix (<i>csfax</i>) -- see <a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=14" target="_blank">bug tracker ID #14</a></li>
  <li>new: ROMAlyzer: added a 'copy to clipboard' function to copy the analysis output for the currently selected set to the system clipboard (as formatted text)</li> 
  <li>wip: completing the support for game/machine <i>attached</i> youtube.com videos -- note: this is a Qt 4.7+ only feature as it uses the embeddable youtube.com video player which in turn needs the npviewer browser plugin (and that's only cleanly supported since Qt 4.7)</li>
  <li>doc: updated <a href="faq.html#A1.7.2">Q1.7.2</a> in FAQ to reflect openSUSE 11.4</li>
  <li>inf: SDLMAME &amp; SDLMESS targets only: the output notifier FIFO (<i>/tmp/sdlmame_out</i>) is no longer removed when QMC2 exits to allow for clean concurrent use by multiple variants (that's actually a work around because SDLMAME &amp; SDLMESS both use the <b>same</b> FIFO, and there's apparently no portable way to find out if it's opened by another process to decide when it's eligible for removal)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>v0.2.b18, 02-JAN-2011:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>fix: welcome dialog: the initial/optional hashpath setting must be stored under MESS (not MAME)</li>
  <li>fix: Qt 4.7+ only: worked around a Qt bug that caused the first embedded emulator whose options were activated to <i>disappear</i> (visually)</li>
  <li>fix: corrected concurrent/mixed joystick control when emulators are embedded</li>
  <li>fix: avoid a QWebInspector warning by setting the application's <i>organization name</i> (only for builds with BROWSER_EXTRAS=1); as a result, QWebInspector will now correctly (re)store its settings in ~/.config/qmc2.conf</li>
  <li>fix: corrected cursor positioning when editing strings in delegated item views (emulator configuration widgets and MESS device setup)</li>
  <li>fix: avoid possible qUncompress() warnings due to empty input data</li>
  <li>fix: embedder: corrected client resizing issues on maximized embedded emulators</li>
  <li>fix: embedder: make sure the next visible embedded emulator (if any) gains input focus when the currently focused embed client is released</li>
  <li>fix: set the codec for C-string conversion to the current locale's codec in order to correctly support unicode characters used in XML data (however, note that this makes the creation of XML- and gamelist-caches a bit slower)</li>
  <li>fix: ROMAlyzer: just because <i>chdman</i> verifies the file integrity as <i>good</i> doesn't mean that it's the wanted file, so we still need to use the header checksums for comparison</li>
  <li>imp: foreign emulator support: a working directory can now also be specified in the registration of foreign emulators (this was particularly added to support RAINE, but it's a good idea anyway)</li>
  <li>imp: SDLMESS/MESS templates updated to 0.140 (no new or changed options)</li>
  <li>imp: SDLMAME/MAME/MAMEUIFX32 templates updated to 0.141 (new options <i>profile</i> and <i>bench</i> for MAME, new option <i>uifont</i> for all, changed default value of <i>coin_lockout</i> for MAMEUIFX32, removed option <i>volume_adjust</i> for MAMEUIFX32, new option <i>hashpath</i> for all)</li>
  <li>imp: UNIX build: forcedly disable pretty compilation output ('make PRETTY=1 ...') for Qt 4.7+ as it produces irritating (but harmless) shell warnings</li>
  <li>imp: updated redistributed Qt translations from Qt 4.7.1</li>
  <li>imp: embedder snapshot tool: the snapshot viewer now also hides itself when the escape key is pressed -- we're no longer bypassing the X11 window manager and are instead using a managed frameless window (the window manager must understand Motif and/or NETWM hints for this to work; however, most - if not all - modern WMs should be able to handle this)</li>
  <li>imp: embedder: cleaner layout handling to avoid flickering borders due to auto-maximization</li>
  <li>imp: ROMAlyzer: checksum columns will only be shown in the analysis report when their calculation has been enabled in the settings</li>
  <li>imp: support for additional XML data in game/machine details (<i>status</i> for ROMs, disks and software-lists, <i>optional</i> for ROMs and disks)</li>
  <li>new: embedder: the embedder options drop down menu now also contains a <i>copy command</i> item</li>
  <li>wip: adding support for game/machine <i>attached</i> youtube.com videos -- will likely only work for Qt 4.7+ as it uses the embeddable youtube.com video player which in turn needs the npviewer browser plugin</li>
</ul>
<p><b>v0.2.b17, 22-OCT-2010:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>fix: embedder snapshot tool: the first snapshot clicked wasn't displayed in the viewer</li>
  <li>fix: demo mode and ROM checks aren't allowed to run at the same time (would crash); additional emulators shouldn't be launched while in demo mode -- both will be avoided now</li>
  <li>fix: ROM check: on fast machines, the first few check results got lost sometimes (this was a serious bug!)</li>
  <li>fix: the game/machine status indicator wasn't correctly updated when the ROM status of the currently selected game/machine changed during a ROM check</li>
  <li>fix: consider the MAWS cache as invalid when the MAWS base URL is changed (cleared now)</li>
  <li>fix: corrected widget layout restoration for image- and sample-check dialogs</li>
  <li>fix: when the tool-executor dialog gets closed while the external program is still running, the process must be killed</li>
  <li>fix: MESS targets only: don't try to load machine icons (we don't support them anyway in case of MESS)</li>
  <li>fix: ROMAlyzer: corrected icon size adjustment</li>
  <li>fix: ROM status toggles were effectively disabled when the applied configuration was restored by the user</li>
  <li>fix: embedder: corrected initial focus and container maximization issues</li>
  <li>fix: joystick test widget: if a style sheet is active, the button test labels must be colorized with a style sheet as well (instead of changing their palette)</li>
  <li>fix: icon sizes of the MAWS quick download setup dialog are now also correctly adjusted</li>
  <li>fix: ini-importer/exporter: when the inipath hasn't been set explicitly, try to use the template's default value instead</li>
  <li>imp: SDLMESS/MESS templates updated to 0.139 (no new options, corrected default value for option <i>writeconfig</i>)</li>
  <li>imp: SDLMAME/MAME/MAMEUIFX32 templates updated to 0.140 (no new or changed options)</li>
  <li>imp: Mac OS X build: determine correct SCM revision used for <i>CFBundleVersion</i> in Info.plist, call <i>macdeployqt</i> only when necessary, use correct permissions on directories for system-wide installation</li>
  <li>imp: demo mode dialog: added a label to display the name of the currently played game</li>
  <li>imp: about dialog: supported MIME types (Phonon backend) shown on the sys-info page are sorted now</li>
  <li>imp: support for additional/new XML data when retrieving game/machine details (<i>configuration</i>, <i>adjuster</i>, <i>category</i> and <i>softwarelist</i>)</li>
  <li>imp: updated the MAWS quick download links to the current site layout</li>
  <li>imp: the tool executor dialog can now auto-close and copy the tool's output to the front end log (i.e. for debugging)</li>
  <li>imp: additional empty-line consolidation for game/machine info texts</li>
  <li>imp: the demo mode dialog now (re)stores its geometry</li>
  <li>imp: build: cleaned up the build system in many aspects, added several new make options (for special build environments)</li>
  <li>imp: keep an internal run-time index of the XML data when searching and retrieving game/machine details (making subsequent retrievals of the same data slightly faster)</li>
  <li>imp: embedder: using the internal emulator ID to set the WM_CLASS property in order to make the emulator's X11 window uniquely identifiable (this means that multiple windows with the same emulated game/machine can now be cleanly embedded!)</li>
  <li>imp: the hierarchical parent/clone view is now also hidden during game/machine list reloads (if applicable)</li>
  <li>imp: embedded emulator windows are now automatically maximized to use <b>all</b> available space within their parent widgets (no margins)</li>
  <li>imp: file &amp; directory editors in the emulator configuration widgets use tool-buttons (instead of push-buttons) now for better consistency</li>
  <li>imp: textual descriptions for emulator exit codes</li>
  <li>imp: using separate semaphores for the serialization of log data (front end and emulator logs)</li>
  <li>new: added generic support to drive a <i>ROM tool</i> for any external processing based on the game/machine ID (<i>$ID$</i>) or description (<i>$DESCRIPTION$</i>)</li>
  <li>new: URLs in the game/machine and emulator info DBs are now directly clickable (opening the URL in the desktop's default browser, if any)</li>
  <li>new: MESS targets only: MESS wiki texts from sysinfo.dat are now converted to HTML (far from perfect, but basically working fine)</li>
  <li>new: experimental support for Qt 4.7 -- browser plugins appear to work nicely using Qt 4.7, so you could enable the compile-time option BROWSER_PLUGINS in this case; however, there's at least one embedder-related issue left: toggling the embedder options will lead to a <i>black screen</i> for the embedded emulator's window, but only the first time it is used (strange)</a></li>
  <li>wip: MESS targets only: completing the support for MESS software lists -- basically working, but some functionality is still missing</li>
  <li>wip: started to add support for an optional ROM/CHD database, a repository to store and retrieve unique copies of ROM and CHD data</li>
  <li>wip: added the current template-tool wip to the SVN trunk</li>
  <li>doc: updated <a href="faq.html#A1.7.1">Q1.7.1</a> and <a href="faq.html#A1.7.2">Q1.7.2</a> in FAQ to reflect Ubuntu 10.04, Ubuntu 10.10 and openSUSE 11.3</li>
  <li>doc: updated the ROM status table in <a href="readme.html#4.">section 4 of the README</a> to better describe the meaning of the different states</li>

  <li>fix: Mac OS X build: removed i386 and ppc requirements from the qmake/xcodebuild configuration</li>
  <li>fix: Mac OS X build: corrected build rules for the mixed Qt/Cocoa environment</li>
  <li>fix: if a font hasn't been set yet, use the QApplication's current font to initially feed the font dialog (on Mac OS X, 'Arial' and 'Courier New' are used as the initial fonts for that dialog)</li>
  <li>fix: removed the deprecated <i>Encoding</i> key in the desktop entry template (see <a href="http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/apc.html" target="_blank">http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/apc.html</a>)</li>

  <li>fix: corrected the welcome dialog's UI (logo pixmap wasn't displayed)</li>
  <li>fix: MP3 player: corrected multi-track selection behavior when in playback mode</li>
  <li>fix: tweaked full sreen startup for Qt 4.6+ to ensure that the main window is raised</li>

  <li>imp: SDLMESS/MESS templates updated to 0.138 (new option <i>newui</i> for MESS only, ignored in all SDLMESS builds)</li>
  <li>imp: SDLMAME/MAME/MAMEUIFX32 templates updated to 0.139 (new option <i>writeconfig</i>)</li>
  <li>imp: added / changed a number of icons in the <i>classic</i> image set</li>
  <li>imp: updated template format to v0.2.3 which adds support for OS-specific default attributes and the ability to ignore certain options on specific OSs (namely Mac OS X)</li>
  <li>imp: besides better text, the welcome dialog now also includes an optional entry to specify the hash path (in case of MESS, which needs it to support software lists cleanly)</li>

  <li>imp: added distribution-specific package specs to the source tree (see directory <i>pkg-specs/</i>)</li>
  <li>imp: delaying automatically triggered ROM checks for 250ms (in the hope it avoids rare crashes on slower systems)</li>

  <li>imp: honoring desktop/screen geometry limits when positioning context menus</li>
  <li>imp: setting the <i>update delay</i> to 'none' (0) will now cause synchronous updates when the game/machine selection changes; values higher than 0 will cause asynchronous updates just as before</li>

  <li>new: the main widget's <i>splitters</i> now have their own context menus to allow for orientation flipping and swapping of their sub-widgets/sub-layouts -- this allows a free (to a certain extent) layout of all major widgets!</li>
  <li>new: embedder: the embedder options toggle button now also includes a drop down menu (opened after a short delay when the button is held down) to terminate/kill the emulator or to add the game/machine to the favorites list (more actions may follow perhaps)</li>

  <li>imp: more flexibility to layout the main widget (note that this can lead to unusable sub-widgets if you overdo what's possible :)</li>
  <li>imp: ROMAlyzer: colorize wrong checksums in red, unknown states in blue</li>
  <li>imp: build: added new <i>ARCADE_OPENGL</i> make option - if enabled (default), QMC2's arcade mode will support OpenGL (if available - direct rendering/hardware acceleration recommended!), otherwise only the software renderer will be available (should be fast enough, though)</li>
  <li>imp: build: added new <i>WIP</i> make option - if set to 1, unfinished code will be made available (default = 0/disabled)</li>
  <li>imp: updated redistributed Qt translations to Qt 4.4.3</li>
  <li>imp: build: added new <i>QT_TRANSLATION</i> make option - set this to the absolute path to your Qt translation files if you don't want to use the ones which are redistributed with QMC2 (which is the default)</li>
  <li>imp: welcome wizard: remove initial sample path setup for MESS variant because MESS doesn't support samples anyway</li>
  <li>imp: added distribution specific build configuration for <i>Mandriva Linux release 2009.0</i></li>
  <li>imp: use <i>-listfull '*'</i> / <i>-listxml '*'</i> (instead of just <i>-listfull</i> / <i>-listxml</i>) to determine the total number of supported games/machines and their detailed XML data - <i>some</i> MAME/MESS builds wouldn't report the full game/machine list without the asterisk</li>

  <li>new: added ROM state filter toggles to the main widget, including new short cuts</li>
  <li>new: added new setting <i>CheckSingleInstance</i> (default: true) to enable/disable a startup check against multi-instance runs of the same QMC2 variant</i>
  <li>new: all QMC2 variants are now <i>separately</i> configured - includes automatic settings conversion (if required) and automatic cloning of a probably already existing front end configuration (from another variant)</i>
  <li>new: added <i>runonce</i> utility to project for use with the QMC2 variant launcher</i>
  <li>new: QMC2 variant launcher: both QMC2 variants (<i>qmc2-sdlmame</i> &amp; <i>qmc2-sdlmess</i>) can launch one another; if the <i>other</i> variant already runs, try raising it - note that this feature is <b>very</b> dependent on the window manager which may decide to ignore XMapRaised(); on KDE for example, it will only work correctly when <i>focus under mouse</i> or <i>focus <b>strictly</b> under mouse</i> has been set!)</li>
  <li>wip: arcade mode (not working in this release -- disabled by default -- use "make WIP=1 ..." for a preview)</li>
  <li>doc: added <a href="faq.html#A2.11">Q2.11</a> to FAQ</li>
  <li>inf: checked SDL 1.3 (experimental!) compatibility of joystick API</li>

<ul>
  <li>fix: startup crash on the creation of the template configuration map under certain circumstances (see tracker #2201714)</li>
  <li>fix: worked around a minor Phonon issue with duplicate metaDataChanged() signals</li>
  <li>imp: SDLMAME options template updated to 0.129 (corrected default value for <i>audio_latency</i>, revised several option descriptions, removed <i>remapjoys</i> and <i>remapjoyfile</i>, added new options <i>joy_idx1</i> - <i>joy_idx8</i>)</li>
  <li>imp: updated template format to include the template's emulator name (new format version 0.2.1)</li>
  <li>imp: ROMAlyzer: determine ROM file CRC identification troubles in ZIPs, log warnings and set the file status to <i>bad</i> in such a case (in contrast to <i>not found</i> as before)</li>
  <li>imp: code cleanup: changed several macro definitions to be consistent within QMC2's namespace</li>
  <li>imp: build: added new make options DISTCC, DISTCC_CC &amp; DISTCC_CXX (uses a distributed compiler such as <i>distcc</i> or <i>icecc</i> if DISTCC is set to 1 - check/set DISTCC_CC / DISTCC_CXX if enabled!)</li>
  <li>imp: slightly improved welcome dialog (logo, button icons and layout)</li>
  <li>imp: build: preserve existing system-wide configuration (usually /etc/qmc2/qmc2.ini) on <i>make install</i></li>
  <li>imp: build: avoid overwriting the Makefile when qmake is accidently called standalone (the project file now sets QMAKE_MAKEFILE to <i>Makefile.qmake</i>)</li>
  <li>imp: build: allow pretty compile output (doesn't work for RCC yet due to a qmake bug) - enabled per default, use make PRETTY=0 to disable</li>
  <li>imp: build: splitted CCACHECMD into CCACHE_CC &amp; CCACHE_CXX</li>
  <li>imp: build: use the same qmc2.pro project file for both debug and release builds (adding CONFIG settings dynamically on qmake call)</li>
  <li>imp: ROMAlyzer: log more CHD v3 header information (CHD tag, writable flag and parent's MD5/SHA1 checksums, if applicable)</li>
  <li>imp: ROMAlyzer: if <i>romof</i> is set in a game's XML data, but the file to merge is missing from this data (= <i>merge</i> attribute is empty), recursively search for the name of the current game's ROM file instead - MAME does exactly this in these rare cases (example: sfiiin)</li>
  <li>imp: ROMAlyzer: produce better status and log information on CHDs that were not found</li>
  <li>imp: allow higher values for <i>gamelist responsiveness</i> - setting this value higher than the total number of games will usually allow for less than 2 seconds of gamelist processing (at the expense of a more or less unresponsive GUI during reload, of course)</li>
  <li>imp: updated XML game info parser to support all current game/machine settings from MAME/MESS</li>
  <li>imp: many [Frontend] settings moved to [MAME] and [MESS] sections (automatically converted if the previous version is less than 0.2.b6)</li>
  <li>imp: code cleanup: make class and variable names emulator independent (i.e. use <i>EmulatorOptions</i> instead of <i>MameOptions</i>)</li>
  <li>new: added new SDLMESS options template (see data/opt/SDLMESS/template.xml, initial version 0.128)</li>
  <li>new: experimental support for SDLMESS (status: very basic and no <i>device</i> support yet)</li>
  <li>new: added plugin helper sample script for emulator startup interception (see scripts/plugin_helper.sh)</li>
  <li>new: all UI files regenerated with Qt 4.4's designer - Qt 4.4.0+ promoted as the new required version, although you may still be able to build it using Qt 4.3 in the short term - <b>Qt 4.3 is no longer supported!</b></li>
  <li>new: added tab icons for all main widget functions</li>
  <li>new: ROM status export tool with support for ASCII, CSV and HTML output formats - can output to file or clipboard</li>
  <li>doc: added <a href="faq.html#A2.10">Q2.10</a> to FAQ</li>

  <li>new: support for MAME output notifications via a named pipe (SDLMAME 0.127+)</li>
  <li>new: emulator control panel changed to a multi-column tree widget displaying more information like the game name, its LEDs (if applicable), the current emulator status and additional notifiers/values not handled statically (in a sub tree)</li>
